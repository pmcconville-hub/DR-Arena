If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use, Apple is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site or any Content, Apple’s liability shall in no event exceed the greater of (1) the total of any subscription or similar fees with respect to any service or feature of or on the Site paid in the six months prior to the date of the initial claim made against Apple (but not including the purchase price for any Apple hardware or software products or any AppleCare or similar support program), or (2) US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you. Indemnity You agree to indemnify and hold Apple, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), made against Apple by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site. Violation of These Terms of Use Apple may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Apple’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Apple’s customers.

You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Apple, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Apple obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Apple deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Apple may have at law or in equity.

The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union.

If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law. Void Where Prohibited Apple administers and operates the www.apple.com Site from its location in Cupertino, California USA; other Apple sites may be administered and operated from various locations outside the United States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide, not all features, products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations, or appropriate or available for use outside the United States. Apple reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product or service to any person or geographic area. Any offer for any feature, product or service made on the Site is void where prohibited. If you choose to access the Site from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws. Miscellaneous You may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of such Content, or any product or service offered on the Site, in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export laws and regulations. If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Apple with regard to your use of the Site, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings previously existing between you and Apple with respect to such use are hereby superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you enter into with Apple, Apple will not accept any counter-offers to these Terms of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. Apple’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver by Apple of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Apple and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.

          "content": "U.S. Sales and Refund Policy Thanks for shopping at Apple. We want you to have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re in an Apple Store location, on Apple Store Online, using the Apple Store App, or calling Retail Customer Care (“Apple Store”). By placing an order or making a purchase at an Apple Store, you agree to the terms below, along with Apple’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use . Standard Return Policy We believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the Apple Store. In the unlikely event a product is not what you expected, you can return or exchange it with a receipt within 14 days of the date you receive the product from Apple. The product must be in its original condition with all of its included parts, accessories, and packaging and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based on the payment method. In addition, please note: Apple products purchased through other retailers must be returned to those retailers in accordance with their returns and refunds policies. Products can be returned only in the country where purchased. For returns for cash or cash equivalent over $750, Apple will mail a refund check to you within 10 business days. For returns with a gift receipt, Apple will offer you an Apple Gift Card. For returns paid with your Apple Account balance, Apple will refund the portion paid to your Apple Account or, if unable, an Apple Gift Card. Returned products may require inspection. If approved, a refund or exchange will be issued within 10 business days. Apple provides security features to protect your product in case of loss or theft. If these features were activated and cannot be disabled by the person in possession, Apple may refuse the return or exchange. To return ten or more of the same product, you must return to the Apple Store where purchased. For complete details on how to return a product purchased at the Apple Store please visit the Returns & Refunds page. Return of AppleCare+ under an iPhone Upgrade Program Should you return the AppleCare+ portion of your iPhone Upgrade Program, you will lose your Upgrade Option as set forth in iPhone Upgrade Program Terms & Conditions . Returns of Products with Wireless Services – Service Cancellation Wireless carriers have different service cancellation policies. Returning Apple products with wireless services may not automatically cancel or reset your wireless account. You are responsible for your wireless service agreement and any fees associated with your wireless account. Please contact your wireless service provider for more information. ZEISS Optical Inserts ZEISS Optical Inserts - Prescription are custom, third-party products and may not be returned to an Apple Store location. Apple will accept returns on behalf of ZEISS within 14 days of the date you receive them. To return, sign in to your Order Listing page or call 1-800-MY-APPLE.

Additional Apple Product Terms The purchase and/or use of Apple products are subject to additional terms and conditions found at https://www.apple.com/legal/sla and https://www.apple.com/legal/warranty . Making unauthorized modifications to the software on an iPhone violates the iPhone software license agreement and is jail-breaking. If you are unable to use your iPhone due to an unauthorized software modification, its repair will not be covered under the warranty. Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections Apple reserves the right to change prices for products at the Apple Store at any time, and to correct inadvertent pricing errors. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment & Pricing page. If you were charged more than the posted price in an Apple Store location, see a Manager about a refund of the overcharge. Should Apple reduce the price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, visit an Apple Store location or contact Retail Customer Care at 1-800-MY-APPLE within 14 days of the price change to request a refund or credit of the difference in price. This excludes limited-time price reductions and special sales events, such as Black Friday. Price protection is limited to 10 units of a particular product and we may require that you have the product with you and/or have proof of possession to use it. Prices shown are in U.S. dollars. If you pay for your order with an international card, the price may fluctuate with exchange rates and/or your card issuer may charge foreign conversion charges and fees. Order Acceptance/Confirmation Apple may refuse or cancel any order or limit order quantity. Apple may also require additional qualifying information prior to processing any order. Once we receive your online or phone order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation does not signify acceptance of your order or constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Apple Store reserves the right to accept or decline your order at any time for any reason. If Apple cancels an order after payment, Apple will refund it. Shipping & Delivery Please review the Shipping & Pickup page to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the Apple Store. Since delivery of your order can be impacted by events beyond Apple’s control once it leaves our facilities, Apple cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery. As Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, products shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the products. Title in the products shall pass to you when the products are picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Apple to resolve. In-Store Pickup and Return Apple offers in-store pickup for many of its products. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and order number will be required for pickup. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. We’ll also send you a reminder or two, in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Apple may cancel it. Please visit http://apple.com/us/shop/help/shipping_delivery for more details. Pickup Contact If you select in-store pickup, you may be able to designate a third party to pick up your order. You must provide their name and email address. Certain products and payment methods are not eligible for in-store pickup by a third party. The third party will need to bring a government issued photo ID and order number for pickup. Apple is not responsible for actions taken by the third party once your item(s) have been picked up. Consumers Only The Apple Store sells and ships products to end-user customers only, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we suspect you are purchasing products for resale. U.S. Sales and Shipping Only The Apple Store accepts orders from billing addresses within the U.S. and most U.S. territories. Products purchased online from the U.S. will only be shipped to addresses within the U.S. and are subject to U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations. Products must be purchased, sold, exported, re-exported, transferred, and used in compliance with these laws and regulations. To purchase Apple products online from outside of the U.S., please visit https://www.apple.com/choose-country-region for international Apple Store information. Product Availability and Limitations Given the popularity and supply constraints of some products, Apple may have to limit the number available for purchase and reserves the right to change the number at any time, even after you place an order. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, Apple will cancel the order and refund your purchase price. Gift Cards Apple Gift Cards cannot be returned.

              "content": "SALES & REFUND TERMS AND CONDITIONS (“TERMS”) U.S. Sales and Refund Policy Thanks for shopping at Apple. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the cool stuff we build. We also want to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at the Apple Online Store, in an Apple Retail Store, or on the phone with the Apple Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.) As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an Apple Store. We’ll be as brief as our attorneys will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or making a purchase at an Apple Store, you agree to the terms set forth below along with Apple’s Privacy Policy (Opens in a new window) and Terms of Use (Opens in a new window) . Standard Return Policy We fundamentally believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the Apple Store. That’s because we go out of our way to ensure that they’re designed and built to be just what you need. We understand, however, that sometimes a product may not be what you expected it to be. In that unlikely event, we invite you to review the following terms related to returning a product. For any undamaged product, simply return it with its included accessories and packaging along with the original receipt (or gift receipt) within 14 days of the date you receive the product, and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based upon the original payment method. In addition, please note the following: Products can be returned only in the country or region in which they were originally purchased. The following products are not eligible for return: electronic software downloads, subscriptions to the Software-Up-To-Date program, Apple Store Gift Cards, and any Apple Developer Connection products. For returns to an Apple Retail Store for cash, cash equivalent, and check transactions over $750, Apple will mail a refund check to you within 10 business days. Should you wish to return ten or more of the same product, you must return to the Apple Store where originally purchased. In the case of items returned with a gift receipt, Apple will offer you an Apple Gift Card. If you paid for any portion of an item with your Apple Account balance, and are owed a refund for returning or cancelling it, we issue that portion of refund back to your Apple Account balance. However, we will issue this refund amount on an Apple Gift Card by email if your Apple Account balance is at or near the maximum limit. Opened software cannot be returned if it contained a seal with the software license on the outside of the package and you could read the software license before opening its packaging. As an exception, you may return Apple-branded software if you do not agree to the licensing terms; however, you may not retain or otherwise use any copies of returned software. Apple provides security features to enable you to protect your product in case of loss or theft. If these features have been activated and cannot be disabled by the person in possession of the phone, Apple may refuse the return or exchange. For complete details on how to return a product purchased at the Apple Store please visit the Returns & Refunds (Opens in a new window) page. Return of AppleCare+ under an iPhone Upgrade Program Should you return the AppleCare+ portion of your iPhone Upgrade Program, please note that you will lose your Upgrade Option as set forth under the terms of the iPhone Upgrade Program (Opens in a new window) . iPhone, iPad and Watch Returns - Wireless Service Cancellation Wireless carriers have different service cancellation policies. Returning your iPhone, iPad or Watch may not automatically cancel or reset your wireless account; you are responsible for your wireless service agreement and for any applicable fees associated with your wireless account. Please contact your wireless service provider for more information. Apple Watch Returns Apple Watch from the Edition collection may only be returned or exchanged if it’s in its original, undamaged and unmarked condition after passing inspection at Apple’s offsite facility. Depending on your original form of tender, a check, wire transfer, or refund to your debit/credit card will be issued within 10 business days provided the returned item is in its original condition. Additional Apple Product Terms The purchase and use of Apple products are subject to additional terms and conditions found at https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/ (Opens in a new window) and https://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/ (Opens in a new window) . Making unauthorized modifications to the software on an iPhone violates the iPhone software license agreement. The common term for modifying an iPhone is jail-breaking, with a particular emphasis on the second part of that term. That’s why we strongly, almost emphatically, recommend that you do not do so. Really. Should you be unable to use your iPhone due to an unauthorized software modification, its repair will not be covered under the warranty. Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the Apple Store at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment & Pricing (Opens in a new window) page. In the event you have been charged more than the posted price for a product in an Apple Retail Store, please see a Manager for a refund of the overcharge. Should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to visit an Apple Retail Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events, such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Price protection is only available for up to 10 units of a particular product. Additionally, we may require that you have the product with you or otherwise have proof of possession when requesting price protection. Prices shown are in U.S. dollars. If you are paying for your order with an international Visa, MasterCard, or American Express credit card, please note that the purchase price may fluctuate with exchange rates. In addition, your bank or credit card issuer may also charge you foreign conversion charges and fees, which may also increase the overall cost of your purchase. Please contact your bank or credit card issuer regarding these fees. Order Acceptance/Confirmation Apple may, in its sole discretion, refuse or cancel any order and limit order quantity. Apple may also require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order. Once we receive your Online or Call Center order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify Apple’s acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Apple Store reserves the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. If Apple cancels an order after you have already been billed, Apple will refund the billed amount. Shipping & Delivery Please review the Shipping & Pickup (Opens in a new window) page to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the Apple Store. Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond Apple’s control once it leaves our facilities, Apple cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery. As Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, product(s) shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the product(s). Title in the product(s) shall pass to you when the product(s) is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Apple to resolve. In-Store Pickup and Return Apple offers in-store pickup for many of the items available on the Online Store. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and order number will be required for pickup. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. We’ll also send you a reminder or two, just in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Apple may cancel it. Please click here (Opens in a new window) for complete details about in-store pickup. Pickup Contact If you select in-store pickup, you may designate a third party to pick up your order. You must provide the name and email address of the third party. Please note that certain products and payment methods are not eligible for in-store pickup by a third party. The third party will need to bring a government issued photo ID and order number for pickup. Apple is not responsible for actions taken by the third party once your item(s) have been picked up. Consumers Only The Apple Store sells and ships products to end-user customers only, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we suspect you are purchasing products for resale. U.S. Shipping Only Products purchased online from Apple will only be shipped to addresses within the U.S. and are subject to U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations. Products must be purchased, sold, exported, re-exported, transferred, and used in compliance with these export laws and regulations. To purchase Apple products online from outside of the U.S., please click here for international store information. Product Availability and Limitations Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some of our products, Apple may have to limit the number of products available for purchase. Trust us, we’re building them as fast as we can. Apple reserves the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order. Furthermore, there may be occasions when Apple confirms your order but subsequently learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, Apple will cancel the order and refund your purchase price in full.

This includes applying for and entering into a new 24-month 0% APR installment loan (“New Installment Loan”) with Bank. Applying for a New Installment Loan requires a new credit check. Trade in your Financed iPhone as directed by Apple; Disable Activation Lock; and Remove your SIM card prior to returning the original Financed iPhone, if exercising your Upgrade Option via apple.com. Early Upgrade Option . At any time after you’ve made six (6) regularly-scheduled installment payments, you may accelerate your payments and become upgrade-eligible by paying the equivalent of at least twelve (12) installment payments under your Installment Loan. Termination of Original Installment Loan After Exercising Upgrade Option . Upon successfully exercising your Upgrade Option and completing your first installment payment on your New Installment Loan as outlined above, Apple will pay any remaining balance due under your original Installment Loan on your behalf to Bank, and Bank will consider your original Installment Loan to be paid in full. Subsequent monthly payments will be made under the terms of your New Installment Loan, subject to the conditions of “Return of New, Upgraded iPhone After Exercising Upgrade Option,” as set forth below. Prompt Return of Financed iPhone . If you exercise your Upgrade Option and do not return your original Financed iPhone as directed by Apple within 14 days, your original Installment Loan will be reinstated and you will be responsible for any missed and/or remaining installment payments, as well as any installment payments under your New Installment Loan. Repairs and Service Replacements . If your Financed iPhone is not in good physical and operational condition when you exercise your Upgrade Option, you will need to exercise your service rights set forth in the applicable AppleCare+ for iPhone Terms and Conditions or AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss Terms and Conditions, including paying any applicable service fee(s) required under the AppleCare+ Plan. In the event you have exhausted your service rights, or the repair is not covered under the AppleCare+ Plan, you must have your Financed iPhone repaired or replaced at an Apple Store or through an Apple Authorized Service Provider at the prevailing service or out of warranty replacement rates. If you are upgrading via apple.com and repairs are not available under the AppleCare+ Plan as outlined above, your original iPhone will be returned to you, the Installment Loan associated with the original Financed iPhone will be reinstated, and you will be responsible for any outstanding installment payments, as well as any installment payments under your New Installment Loan.

If you’ve selected AppleCare+ for iPhone and your iPhone has been lost or stolen, you will not be eligible for the Upgrade Option and you should cancel your plan by calling AppleCare at (800) 275-2273. Trade-in Service Provider . Apple may use a Trade-In Service Provider to facilitate the trade in of your Financed iPhone. Upon exercising your Upgrade Option, title and ownership of the Financed iPhone transfers to Apple or the Trade-In Service Provider, and you disclaim any further right, title or interest in and to the Financed iPhone, and assign to Apple the right to collect from the Trade-In Service Provider, where applicable, the value of the Financed iPhone, in exchange for Apple paying the balance of your original Installment Loan on your behalf to Bank. Apple or the Trade-In Service Provider may amend or supplement the terms and conditions that govern the trade in of your Financed iPhone. Any fees, charges, or payments made to exercise the Upgrade Option are not reversible and will not be refunded. Data on the Financed iPhone . You are solely responsible for removing all data, including confidential and personal data, from the Financed iPhone prior to the trade-in. It is your sole responsibility to back-up any files or data from your Financed iPhone that you wish to retain prior to trading-in your Financed iPhone. Data recovery is not a part of the iPhone Upgrade Program and neither Apple nor the Trade-In Service Provider accept any responsibility or liability for any lost files or data. Return of New, Upgraded iPhone After Exercising Upgrade Option . Should you exercise the Upgrade Option and subsequently return your new, upgraded iPhone under the terms of Apple’s Returns and Refunds Policy , the Financed iPhone that you traded in will not be returned to you and the New Installment Loan associated with your new, upgraded iPhone will be terminated. Termination of the AppleCare+ Plan. You understand that you have purchased an AppleCare+ plan with funds borrowed from Bank under an Installment Loan. If the AppleCare+ plan associated with your iPhone Upgrade Program is returned or terminated for any reason, including when you exercise your Upgrade Option, any refund due on your AppleCare+ plan will be remitted to the Bank as a payment toward any amount owed by you to Bank. If you do not cancel AppleCare+ on your own, you agree that the Bank is permitted to cancel AppleCare+ on your behalf. If the AppleCare+ refund amount is greater than the amount owed on the Installment Loan, Bank will issue you a refund in the amount of the difference to the credit or debit card you used to enroll in the iPhone Upgrade Program. Trade in Outside of your Upgrade Option . You may decide to trade-in your Financed iPhone outside of the iPhone Upgrade Program for any reason (e.g., if the market value of your trade-in exceeds the outstanding balance on your Installment Loan). If you do so, you will still be responsible for any remaining balance on your Installment Loan to Bank and you will not be able to exercise the Upgrade Option as set forth above. You should also cancel the AppleCare+ Plan associated with the Financed iPhone by contacting AppleCare at: (800) 275-2273 after your trade-in. Extended Fraud Alert. If you have placed an extended fraud alert on your credit file, your identity must be verified by Bank before you can enroll in the iPhone Upgrade Program. General Subject to Availability.

We also want to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at the Apple Online Store, in an Apple Retail Store, or on the phone with the Apple Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.) As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an Apple Store. We’ll be as brief as our attorneys will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or making a purchase at an Apple Store, you agree to the terms set forth below along with Apple’s Privacy Policy (Opens in a new window) and Terms of Use (Opens in a new window) . Standard Return Policy We fundamentally believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the Apple Store. That’s because we go out of our way to ensure that they’re designed and built to be just what you need. We understand, however, that sometimes a product may not be what you expected it to be. In that unlikely event, we invite you to review the following terms related to returning a product. For any undamaged product, simply return it with its included accessories and packaging along with the original receipt (or gift receipt) within 14 days of the date you receive the product, and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based upon the original payment method. In addition, please note the following: Products can be returned only in the country or region in which they were originally purchased.

Should you wish to return ten or more of the same product, you must return to the Apple Store where originally purchased. In the case of items returned with a gift receipt, Apple will offer you an Apple Gift Card. If you paid for any portion of an item with your Apple Account balance, and are owed a refund for returning or cancelling it, we issue that portion of refund back to your Apple Account balance. However, we will issue this refund amount on an Apple Gift Card by email if your Apple Account balance is at or near the maximum limit. Opened software cannot be returned if it contained a seal with the software license on the outside of the package and you could read the software license before opening its packaging. As an exception, you may return Apple-branded software if you do not agree to the licensing terms; however, you may not retain or otherwise use any copies of returned software. Apple provides security features to enable you to protect your product in case of loss or theft. If these features have been activated and cannot be disabled by the person in possession of the phone, Apple may refuse the return or exchange.

              "content": "APO/FPO Shipments NOTE: As of November 15, 2012, US Postal Service regulations allow the shipment of products containing lithium-based batteries to APO, FPO, or DPO locations. USPS still prohibits the shipment of stand-alone lithium-based batteries, such as a replacement MacBook Pro battery. If you intend to purchase a stand-alone lithium battery for shipment to an APO, FPO or DPO address, please contact your freight forwarding service before making your purchase to determine product eligibility and delivery options to your desired destination. Apple does not ship directly to APO/FPO addresses. However, there are a number of third-party forwarding services that can conveniently redirect Apple Store shipments to APO/FPO addresses for a fee. Here’s how it works: Sign up with one of the freight forwarding services such as APO Box (Opens in a new window) , or select another provider of your choosing. Then simply return to the Apple Online Store for Government and Military Employees to complete your order using the new U.S. address provided by the forwarding service. It’s really that simple. Apple will ship your order to your new U.S. shipping address and the forwarding service will forward your order to your APO/FPO address. (Fees and service vary by vendor.) APO/FPO Shipping Charges: Please note that in addition to the standard shipping charges billed by Apple Inc., the forwarding service has its own charge for getting your order to your APO/FPO address. These additional fees include handling fees, Priority Mail postage, and any optional insurance coverage. Both the postage and insurance are charged at published U.S. Postal Service rates. APO/FPO Insurance (Highly Recommended): For APO/FPO Shipments, Apple is not responsible for loss or damage to products during shipment from the third-party forwarding service to APO/FPO. Therefore, we highly recommend that you insure each package for up to its full value. Insurance costs range from $3.20 for $200.00 worth of coverage to $21.00 for $2000.00 worth of coverage. APO/FPO Delivery Time: Please note that APO/FPO deliveries can take up to 6-8 weeks depending on local conditions at destination. Forwarding services use US Postal Service (USPS) to deliver to APO/FPO addresses, and USPS package tracking is not available to final destination. Returns: Please notify the Apple support agent that your return will initiate from an APO/FPO address. Please click here for the process.

          "description": "iOS and iPadOS monitor the storage on your device by analyzing how much space each app uses. You can also check the storage on your device in Settings, or in iTunes or the Finder on your computer.",
          "content": "When your device is low on storage, it frees up space by removing items that you can redownload or aren't needed, like unused apps and temporary files. Go to Settings > General > [Device] Storage, where you'll see recommendations and a list of apps with their storage usage. Tap an app's name for more information about its storage. Cached data and temporary data might not count as usage. In the detailed view you can: Offload the app, which frees up storage used by the app, but keeps its documents and data. Delete the app, which removes the app and its related data. Depending on the app, you might be able to delete some of its documents and data. If your device shows a \"Storage Almost Full\" alert, check the storage recommendations or remove some content, such as videos and apps. Here's a list of the types of content on your device, and what each type includes: Apps: Installed apps and their content, and content stored in \"On My iPhone/iPad/iPod touch\" directory in the Files app, and Safari downloads. Photos: Photos and videos stored in the Photos app. Media: Music, videos, podcasts, ringtones, artwork, and Voice Memos. Mail: Emails and their attachments. Apple Books: Books and PDFs in the Books app. Messages: Messages and their attachments. iCloud Drive: iCloud Drive content that you downloaded locally to your device. 1 Other: Non-removable mobile assets, like Siri voices, fonts, dictionaries, non-removable logs and caches, Spotlight index, and system data, such as Keychain and CloudKit Database. 2 System: Space taken by the operating system. This can vary based on your device and model. In the Storage section of Settings, your device might offer recommendations for optimizing your storage. To optimize your storage: Tap Show All to see the recommendations for your device. Read the description of each recommendation, then tap Enable to turn it on or tap the recommendation to review the contents that you can delete. Switch to the Finder on your Mac, or open the Apple Devices app on your PC. If your PC doesn't have the Apple Devices app, or your Mac is using macOS Mojave or earlier, open iTunes instead. Find out which macOS your Mac is using . Connect your device to your computer. Select your device in the sidebar of the Finder window or Apple Devices app. If using iTunes, select your device in the upper-left corner of the iTunes window. You'll see a bar that shows how much storage your content uses, divided by content type. Move your mouse over the bar to see how much storage each content type is using. Here's a list of the types of content on your device, and what each type includes: Audio: Songs, audio podcasts, audiobooks, voice memos, and ringtones. Video: Movies, music videos, and TV shows. Photos: Content in your Photo Library, Camera Roll, and Photo Stream. Apps: Installed apps. Documents & Data lists the content of the apps. Books: iBooks books, audio books, and PDF files. Documents & Data: Safari Offline Reading List, files stored within installed apps, and app content like contacts, calendars, messages, and emails (and their attachments). Other: Settings, Siri voices, system data, and cached files. Synced content: Media content that you synchronize from your computer when you click Sync in the Finder window. 3 The Finder, Apple Devices app, and iTunes show cached music, videos, and photos as \"Other\" storage. The system creates these files when you stream or view content, allowing for faster access the next time you want to enjoy content. Your device removes these files when your device needs more space. Since the Finder, Apple Devices app, and iTunes categorize cached files as Other, reported usage for Music or Videos might differ. To view usage on your device, go to Settings > General > [Device] Storage. To free up space, your device removes cached and temporary files, so you don't have to. 1. You can't delete iCloud content automatically. 2. The system can't delete cached files. 3. You can't remove data in Synced content using your iPhone. To remove this data, switch to the Finder, or open the Apple Devices app or iTunes, deselect the data, and click Sync.

              "content": "At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company (collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them. At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com for Apple or shazam.com/privacy for Shazam. To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from privacy.apple.com , you can make a request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact . You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator. There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable. If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page, you or your authorized agent can make a request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273. For more information on exercising your rights, visit support.apple.com/102283 . At Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy. This means that we strive to collect only the personal data that we need . The personal data Apple collects depends on how you interact with Apple.

Details such as the content of your communications with Apple, including interactions with customer support and contacts through social media channels You are not required to provide the personal data that we have requested.

At Your Direction. You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with Apple. For example, you may direct your mobile carrier to share data about your carrier account with Apple for account activation, or for your loyalty program to share information about your participation so that you can earn rewards for Apple purchases. Apple Partners. We may also validate the information you provide — for example, when creating an Apple Account, with a third party for security, and for fraud-prevention purposes. To power features such as search and as a source for our foundational AI models, Apple uses Applebot, a web crawler, to crawl information that is publicly available on the internet. We have measures in place to reduce the amount of personal data we collect and make no attempt to connect data crawled to any individual Apple user, or to build profiles about individuals. Your private personal data is not used to train our foundational AI models. To exercise your right as an individual to opt out of processing, visit the Apple Intelligence Privacy Inquiries form . For more information about Applebot, visit support.apple.com/120320 .

Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent. Apple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More information is available in the product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above.

Process Your Transactions. To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information. Communicate with You. To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices. Security and Fraud Prevention. To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.

We make this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon; it’s also available at all times on your Apple device and online at apple.com/legal/privacy/data . Comply with Law. To comply with applicable law — for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request. Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law. Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law. Apple may share personal data with Apple-affiliated companies , service providers who act on our behalf, our partners , developers, and publishers , or others at your direction . Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes. Service Providers.

Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once they’ve fulfilled our request. Partners. At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data. Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription. If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions. Others. Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale. Apple does not sell your personal data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California. Apple also does not “share” your personal data as that term is defined in California.

We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our Apple Platform Security guide. Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction . That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children’s personal data safe. To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A child Apple Account may be created by the parent or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the child’s educational institution . Parents. To create a child account, parents must review the Family Privacy Disclosure for Children , which describes how Apple handles children’s personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent. Educational Institutions. Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called “Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement. If we learn that a child’s personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.

If you’re in a noisy environment, there is the added ability to use your iPhone's microphones in addition to those on AirPods to enhance the translation performance. To do this, you can simply try moving your iPhone closer to the other person speaking. Speak your response. Use the Live tab in the Translate app on your iPhone to show a transcript to the person you’re speaking with, or press the Play button to play a translation on your iPhone speaker. If the person you’re speaking with has supported AirPods and has set up and started Live Translation, they can use their AirPods to listen to your response. To stop Live Translation, tap the X button. Live Translation with AirPods works on AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation and AirPods Pro 2 and later with the latest firmware when paired with an Apple Intelligence–enabled iPhone running iOS 26 and later. Some features may not be available in all regions or languages. Live Translation with AirPods is not available for EU residents whose device is in the EU and whose Apple Account Country or Region is also in the EU. Apple Intelligence users based in other regions can continue to use Live Translation with AirPods anywhere they travel. Live Translation uses generative models, and outputs may be inaccurate, unexpected, or offensive. Check important information for accuracy. Published Date: November 18, 2025",

Face ID or Touch ID turned on. An Apple Account with two-factor authentication turned on . A license or ID from a participating US state or territory . Your device region set to United States. IDs in Apple Wallet take advantage of the privacy and security features already built into iPhone and Apple Watch to help protect against tampering and theft. Your driver's license or ID data is encrypted. Neither the issuing authority nor Apple can see when and where you use your license or ID, and biometric authentication using Face ID and Touch ID helps make sure that only you can view and use your license or ID. Learn how Apple protects your personal information and identity data Your license or ID can be added to one iPhone and Apple Watch per Apple Account at a time. The issuing authority, not Apple, makes the decision to approve or deny your request to add your license or ID to Apple Wallet. On your iPhone, open the Wallet app. Tap the Add Card button . Tap Driver's License or ID Cards and choose your state or region. Choose whether you want to add your license or ID to your iPhone only or to both your iPhone and paired Apple Watch. Follow the onscreen instructions to scan the front and back of your license or ID. Use a well-lit area and a neutral background. Make sure that your image is clear and in focus before submitting. Next, you need to confirm that you're you. If you want to add your license or ID to your Apple Watch later: On your iPhone, open the Apple Watch app and tap the My Watch tab. Then scroll down, tap Wallet & Apple Pay, and find your license or ID listed under Other Cards on Your Phone. Tap the Add button next to it and follow the onscreen instructions. To prove that you're really you, you'll be asked to take a Live Photo or a selfie. In some cases, you might be prompted to also complete a series of facial or head movements. For example, you might be asked to smile or turn your head to the right. If you're asked to complete these movements, hold each movement until your iPhone vibrates. To help this process: Stand in front of a plain background, like a wall with neutral paint. Make sure that you're in a well-lit area with even lighting. Indoors works best. Take off any sunglasses, masks, hats, or other accessories. Hold your iPhone as steady as possible. When you're ready to send your information to your issuing authority, authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID. This authentication associates your license or ID with your face or fingerprint to help make sure that only you can use your license or ID. If you use an accessibility feature, instead of having Face ID or Touch ID turned on, you can use your passcode to set up and then use your license or ID. Accessibility features include Voice Control, Switch Control, or AssistiveTouch. In some cases, your issuing authority might require additional information. If you receive a notification, tap it to go to their website. Follow the onscreen instructions to provide the additional information. In Setup Assistant on your new iPhone, tap Wallet. Select your ID. Follow the onscreen instructions. Tap Continue to confirm that you want to move your ID to your new device. If there's a problem adding your driver's license or service is temporarily unavailable, try again later or contact the issuing authority. Learn how to check if you're experiencing an Apple service outage . If your driver's license can't be added, contact the issuing authority. On your iPhone, open the Wallet app. Tap your license or ID to see where you have used it. This information is stored only on the device you used to present. To delete a presentation from your latest activity, tap it, then scroll down and tap Remove Activity. To see more information, tap the Info button . Tap Driver's License Info or ID Info. Authenticate with the Face ID or Touch ID that you used to add your license or ID. In addition to your license or ID information: You can find the issuing authority's contact information. If you use Touch ID and have multiple fingerprints enrolled, you see the option to Replace Fingerprint and change which fingerprint you use to present your license or ID. To protect your privacy, screenshots of this information screen can't be taken. Tell us more about what's happening, and we’ll suggest what you can do next.

Go to the Find My app (or Find My Devices). In the devices list, find the AirPods that you want to remove. Tap the name, then tap Remove or Remove This Device. If you can't remove the device or item and unpair it from an Apple Account, you should reset it.

Ratings & Reviews 2.3 out of 5 8.6K Ratings Ok so my biggest issue with this app and basically any of the translation apps is they never give u the different options. Like with Spanish. U select Spanish but they only give you the “Spain” Spanish..not the Mexico Spanish. And if u know any Spanish at all you know that that actually is a HUGE issue.. being as the two aren’t the same. So u could say somethin in Spain Spanish and it not mean anything at all or is off.. it’s really annoying and honestly I don’t understand why the people who make the app like the ppl who speak the language they are adding doesn’t say anything or whatever to make the creator’s actually add the correct things.. I mean y’all put all this time into making the app and all the languages right? So why in the world would u basically cut it short by being lazy and not adding the ‘Mexico’ one.. it’s just really annoying and if they actually did that they’d get 5 stars..I’m being nice with the 2 stars I voted.. that’s how big of a deal that actually is and I’m not sure why no one has fixed that.. I mean I can’t be the only one who has a problem with that.. so if they don’t add that soon I’ll likely delete the app for snothoer. The only reason I’ve got this app is cuz it came on the phone wen I bought the phone from Verizon. So I figured it’d likely be the best one I could get BUT, CLEARLY I’m wrong cuz there’s better ones out there and there’s a good chance I’ll delete this one for another I am currently using this app along with Siri. I am finding it helpful, but would’ve given it a higher score if it wasn’t for the fact that Siri doesn’t provide, and I believe the app doesn’t either, consistent honorifics when translating. I believe honorifics are important especially when it comes to most Asian languages. This is extremely important for foreigners who are trying to learn a language involving honorifics. The automatic installation of honorifics in the translations with the option to see the translation without it at the touch of a switch would be very helpful. I hope you will take my review and suggestions seriously. For quite some time I’ve been trying to self learn Hangul. I will admit it was hard just before writing this review that I realized Siri could translate back so easily. One last suggestion, if it’s not already installed. Once the first issues are resolved would it be possible to have Siri respond in the foreign language of the user’s choice? In addition, the user can choose whether or not have Siri speak back in honorifics. As someone who has tried many different ways to learn Hangul, will you please consider my suggestions and recommendations? Thank you. Why hasn’t this app added more supported languages, yet? ESPECIALLY for IOS 17?! Latin should ABSOLUTELY be included, not only for personal purposes, but educational. Latin is fundamental to medical education, translation of older texts, animal studies, and so much more! And we need to go BEYOND Latin! Like dialects would be great, but that’s a lot. We could at the very least have options like Spanish (Central & South America), as well as, Spanish (Spain) as they are very different. And that’s just one example. With all of the ways to communicate globally, I would think Apple would be on the forefront of evolving this type of technology in communication. Not to mention, with all of the global migrations, be it from refugees, immigrants, people who are studying abroad, etc., it is ESSENTIAL that we are able to communicate in a sincere and meaningful manner to avoid conflict and discourse. We should absolutely be expanding on this aspect of these issues to evolve as human beings. C’mon Apple. We can do better. We have to. Especially if you claim to be the “best” and after the radiation issues in France? Or all of the many other issues your company has and will face as tech and AI continue to evolve. You can’t say your the best in security anymore. Pegasus proved that, even though your company tried to keep it quiet. And if you can’t step up? Then I fully support a new company that will. Look (sigh) i want to like this, but tbh i don’t think this app is even accurate, i typed stuff in Japanese and Korean and Arabic because I was curious (English US is my native language)and when typing in random characters, I tend to get some…wacky results, heck sometimes I get the same wacky results when typing in completely different characters of the same language. I decided to test this app. I typed in سخيامبسنطصكيض on this app and Google translate, your app gave me “Scheyam, I’m going to sleep” but Google Translate gave me “Squishy Snacks” I then typed in another translation and the same thing happened, major differences in results. I trust Google more as their translations seem to be more accurate and make more sense than this wacky app, plus the reviews suggest the same thing. Also there is a severe shortage of languages on here! I’m Portuguese as my ancestors and grandparents come from Portugal (Azores) and I wanted to learn more, but this app, like most, offers only Brazilian Portuguese, and both have differences in words and dialects. I also heard that many on here want Hebrew and Latin American Spanish on here, I also agree that those should be options. What about Udru (the second most spoken language in the world) what about Swedish? What about Polish? Finnish? Heck where is Mongolian? 1 star, very dissatisfied.

                  "content": "At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company (collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them. At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com for Apple or shazam.com/privacy for Shazam. To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from privacy.apple.com , you can make a request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact . You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator. There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable. If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page, you or your authorized agent can make a request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273. For more information on exercising your rights, visit support.apple.com/102283 . At Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy.

Apple Partners. We may also validate the information you provide — for example, when creating an Apple Account, with a third party for security, and for fraud-prevention purposes. To power features such as search and as a source for our foundational AI models, Apple uses Applebot, a web crawler, to crawl information that is publicly available on the internet. We have measures in place to reduce the amount of personal data we collect and make no attempt to connect data crawled to any individual Apple user, or to build profiles about individuals. Your private personal data is not used to train our foundational AI models. To exercise your right as an individual to opt out of processing, visit the Apple Intelligence Privacy Inquiries form .

For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices, or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law, including law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to reidentify individuals who may appear therein. Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent. Apple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so.

Process Your Transactions. To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information. Communicate with You. To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback.

Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices. Security and Fraud Prevention. To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.

Comply with Law. To comply with applicable law — for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request. Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law. Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law. Apple may share personal data with Apple-affiliated companies , service providers who act on our behalf, our partners , developers, and publishers , or others at your direction . Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes. Service Providers. Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once they’ve fulfilled our request. Partners. At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data. Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription. If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions. Others. Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale. Apple does not sell your personal data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California. Apple also does not “share” your personal data as that term is defined in California. At Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our Apple Platform Security guide. Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction . That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children’s personal data safe. To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A child Apple Account may be created by the parent or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the child’s educational institution . Parents. To create a child account, parents must review the Family Privacy Disclosure for Children , which describes how Apple handles children’s personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent. Educational Institutions. Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called “Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement. If we learn that a child’s personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.

Apple complies with laws on the transfer of personal data between countries to help ensure your data is protected, wherever it may be. The Apple entity that controls your personal data may differ depending on where you live. For example, Apple Store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and Apple Media Services-related personal data may be controlled by various Apple entities as reflected in the terms of service. If you do not reside in the U.S., your personal data may be processed by Apple Inc. and other Apple-affiliated companies on behalf of the Apple entity controlling personal data for your jurisdiction. For example, Imagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps and to support our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc. in California. Personal data relating to individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland. Apple’s international transfer of personal data collected in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is governed by Standard Contractual Clauses . If you have questions or would like a copy of Apple’s Standard Contractual Clauses, you can contact us at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact . Personal data collected by Apple or an Apple-affiliated company worldwide is generally stored by Apple Inc. in the United States. Regardless of where your personal data is stored, Apple maintains the same high level of protection and safeguarding measures. Apple’s privacy practices, as described in this Privacy Policy, comply with the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System. For more information about the Global CBPR and PRP Systems, visit Global CBPR Forum . To view our certifications, visit Global CBPR System Directory .

Personal data relating to individuals in the People’s Republic of China may be processed by Apple in countries outside of the People’s Republic of China, such as Apple Inc. in the United States or Apple Distribution International Limited in the Republic of Ireland. Where this occurs, it will be done in compliance with local laws, including the Personal Information Protection Law. For the purposes of processing set out in this Privacy Policy, Apple may also transfer such personal data to third-party service providers, who may in turn store or transfer the data outside of the People’s Republic of China. For more information, visit China Mainland Privacy Disclosures . To make sure your personal data is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.

You can also ask us questions about how to submit a privacy complaint and we will endeavor to help. Apple takes your privacy questions seriously. A dedicated team reviews your inquiry to determine how best to respond to your question or concern, including those inquiries received in response to an access or download request. In most cases, all substantive contacts receive a response within seven days. In other cases, we may require additional information or let you know that we need more time to respond. Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues, we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity. In the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person, we will take steps to address that with you or that other person. You may at any time — including if you are not satisfied with Apple’s response — refer your complaint to the applicable regulator. If you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances. When there is a material change to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post a notice on this website at least a week in advance of doing so and contact you directly about the change if we have your data on file.

                  "description": "The App Store includes detailed privacy information that helps you understand each app's data collection practices.",
                  "content": "In June 2020, Apple announced a new privacy information section for product pages on the App Store. This is the beginning of an innovative new program to help customers have more transparency and understanding about what data apps may gather about them. This program creates an easy-to-understand system for all apps, where the information is self-reported by the developer. Apple will continue to provide resources to developers to help them fill out this information accurately. This privacy information section will evolve over time as we all learn what works best for everyone. The privacy information section helps you understand an app’s privacy practices on any Apple platform. On each app’s product page, you can learn about some of the data types the app may collect, and whether that data is linked to you or used to track you. Learn how the App Privacy section defines the different types of data an app might collect — including location, contact info, health info and more — and some of the ways the developer or its third-party partners may use it, like for advertising or analytics. Data that is listed as linked to you means that the data is collected in a way that is linked to your identity, such as to your account, your device, or your details (for example, your phone number). To declare that data is collected but not linked to you, a developer must use privacy protections such as stripping any direct identifiers, for example user ID, before collection, and avoid practices like linking the data back to your identity after collection. Learn more about data linked to you Data used to track you refers to data from the app that is linked with your data collected from other companies’ apps, websites, or offline properties, and used for ads or shared with a data broker. Some examples of tracking include: An app displaying targeted advertisements based on user data collected from apps and websites owned by other companies. An app sharing device location data or email lists with a data broker. An app sharing a list of emails, advertising IDs, or other IDs with a third-party advertising network that uses that information to retarget you in other developers’ apps. Learn more about tracking You can see a list of definitions of the data types collected, along with definitions of the different uses visible in the privacy information section. If an app has multiple possible use cases with different data collection practices, the privacy information section should include the practices of all of them, and how they are used. For example, if an app has different data collection practices for a free version and a paid version of the app, it should report all of the data types collected for both cases. There also may be differences between child-only and adult versions of an app, differences between data collection in different regions, and other differences depending on your use of the app. The app developer’s privacy policy may provide more detail about how its data collection practices may vary in different cases. If a developer asks for information from you inside the app, they still need to disclose that data in the privacy information section. In limited cases, developers may choose not to disclose a data type that is collected, if the collection is infrequent and is not part of the app’s primary functionality, it is collected in a way that is clear in the experience what data is collected, your account information or name is prominently displayed, and you make a clear choice to share the information. In addition, apps do not need to declare information that is collected only by Apple, such as App Analytics or payment information used for in-app purchases. Apps also don’t need to declare data if they are facilitating regulated financial services and the collection meets certain conditions or when collection is subject to an informed consent form as part of a health research study that has been reviewed by an ethics review board. Learn more about developer optional disclosure Apple provides settings and controls to help you manage what data is shared with apps. Learn more about ways to take control of the data you share with apps In addition to controls provided in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, Apple provides data and privacy tools at Apple's Data and Privacy page that help you take control of the data you store with us. When you sign in with your Apple Account credentials, the complete set of self-service data and privacy tools is available: Get a copy of the data that you store with Apple that's associated with your Apple Account. Deactivate your Apple Account temporarily. Delete your Apple Account — and the data associated with it — permanently. Transfer a copy of your data to another service (including your iCloud Photos collection and your Apple Music playlists ). Request a correction to your personal data. At Apple, we work hard to ensure our hardware, software, and services use innovative privacy technologies and techniques to minimize how much of a customer’s data we — or anyone else — can access. The privacy information summaries for our own apps detail our own data collection practices, listing the types of data our apps may collect and whether that data may or may not be linked to a user or device. Because of the variety of apps we offer and the different experiences they provide to customers, these privacy summaries vary by app and will be updated as we continue to work on new ways to protect our customers’ information. Providing these details helps customers stay informed and make better decisions about their own privacy. We will continue to work hard to make our apps deliver even better experiences while designing them with privacy in mind from the beginning. You can find privacy information sections for Apple apps in those apps’ product pages on the App Store, as well as at apple.com/privacy/labels , which also includes Apple apps that don't have dedicated App Store pages. Why do some Apple apps that allow you to back up your data to the cloud list that data in the privacy information section, while others do not? The privacy information section is designed to give you transparency into data that is collected as part of using the app. Some Apple apps, for example Photos and Messages, give you the choice to back up app data outside of the app. These apps don’t declare the data types that are backed up in their privacy information section. Other Apple apps, for example iMovie, give you the choice to back up inside the app. These apps do declare the data types that are backed up in their privacy information section. You can control which apps are backing up to iCloud on your iPhone in Settings > [your name] > iCloud > iCloud Backup. Why is Device Identifier collected as Data Linked to You for some Apple apps but not others? Whether the device ID is linked to you or not linked to you depends on the nature of the ID and whether Apple can link it to user identity. If it can be linked to your identity we have listed it as Data Linked to You, and if it cannot be linked to your identity, then it is listed as Data Not Linked to you. For example, Contacts shares a device identifier with Apple, but it is not linked to your identity, so Device Identifier is listed as Data Not Linked to You. Why do Apple News and Stocks collect Data Linked to You? Apple News and Stocks use a limited set of data linked to user identity. Purchase history is used to enable access to premium content from Apple News+ or from publisher channels with individual subscriptions. Email addresses are used in Apple News only for newsletters, and only for users who opt in to receive emails or users who opt to share their email addresses with partners for access to partner websites. The content users read is associated with a random identifier that isn’t linked to a user and is not linked to other Apple services. Separate random advertising identifiers are also used to serve appropriate ads. Learn more about Apple News and privacy Why does Maps collect Health and Fitness data?

In the Translate app, Other User Content refers to the text you enter to obtain a translation. Learn more about translation and privacy What data does the Health app collect? If you choose to enable Improve Health and Activity, certain activity, workout, and health-related information from your iOS device and Apple Watch will be sent to Apple in order to develop, improve, and understand the effectiveness of health, activity, and fitness features. Your data will not be used for any other purpose, and does not include personally identifiable information. The information collected as part of Improve Health and Activity includes data that is shown in the Health and Fitness apps on your iOS device and the Activity app on your Apple Watch. Learn more about Improve Health & Activity and privacy What data does the Fitness app collect? If you subscribe to Fitness+, Apple may collect information about your search, browsing, and workouts in order to develop, improve, and understand the effectiveness of Apple Fitness+ features and workouts. If you choose to enable Improve Apple Fitness+, your workout titles and trainers will also be collected. All of this data is stored against a random, rotating identifier that is specific to Apple Fitness+ and not associated with your Apple Account. If you explore the Fitness+ tab prior to subscribing, Apple collects information about your browsing activity, and this information is associated with your Apple Account. Learn more about Apple Fitness+ and privacy What data does the Wallet app collect? With Wallet, you can keep your credit and debit cards (if Apple Pay is available in your market), transit cards, airline boarding passes, event tickets, student ID cards, and more in one place on your iPhone or Apple Watch. Financial information is collected if you use Apple Pay (in countries and regions where Apple Pay is available) and this limited set of data is used to improve the Apple Pay customer experience. For example, Apple uses payment information, such as a list of payment cards added to Apple Pay, to let customers remotely remove these cards. Also, when you add a card to Apple Pay, card-related information, device settings, coarse device location, and device use patterns may be sent to determine Apple Pay eligibility of your card and prevent fraud. Apple Pay does not store the original credit or debit card number. And when you use Apple Pay with credit, debit, or prepaid cards, Apple doesn’t retain any transaction information that can be tied back to you. Learn more about Apple Pay and privacy Why does Apple Music collect Data Linked to You? To help Apple Music features — like Listen Now, Personal Mixes, Stations, Autoplay, Search and new release notifications — better reflect your musical tastes, Apple collects information about your activity in the app. The songs that you stream aren’t used by any other service to advertise to you. If you don’t want to keep your music collection on our servers, you can opt out of Sync Library. Apple Music is obligated to share some data with partners, like record labels, for purposes such as royalty payments to artists, but it only does so with industry-leading privacy protections. For example, non-personal information is shared with labels using a random identifier that rotates monthly. Only aggregate data is shared with other partners, like artists. Learn more about Apple Music and privacy Why does Phone collect Data Linked to You? If you have hearing or speech difficulties, you can communicate by telephone using Teletype (TTY) or real-time text (RTT) — protocols that transmit text as you type and allow the recipient to read the message right away. To deliver these services, Apple has to link the data to you to deliver your messages to the person you are calling, and vice versa. Learn more about TTY and RTT What data do Pages, Numbers and Keynote collect? When you turn on iCloud sharing with Pages, Numbers, and Keynote to invite people to collaborate on a document, spreadsheet, or presentation, your name, email address, and phone number are collected and associated with you to enable this functionality. In addition, data is collected to improve the product, including to understand the effectiveness of existing product features, plan new features, or measure usage. When you turn on iCloud syncing to access your document, spreadsheet, or presentation on multiple devices, your user ID is collected to enable this functionality and related analytics data is collected and associated with your device ID. And if you have opted in to help Apple improve our products and services automatically, usage data such as app launches may also be collected. Why does Shazam collect Other Data Types? When you use Shazam to sample audio, it is converted on device into a representation which is then sent to the server to see if a match can be found in Shazam’s music catalog. The audio itself never leaves the device, and the representation is designed to not allow for reconstruction of the original audio. Shazam stores the representations under certain circumstances—for example, if the signature doesn’t match immediately, it is stored and rechecked periodically for a few days for possible matches to updates in the catalog. Learn more about Shazam and privacy Information about products not manufactured by Apple, or independent websites not controlled or tested by Apple, is provided without recommendation or endorsement.

Go to Settings > General > [Device] Storage, where you'll see recommendations and a list of apps with their storage usage. Tap an app's name for more information about its storage. Cached data and temporary data might not count as usage. In the detailed view you can: Offload the app, which frees up storage used by the app, but keeps its documents and data. Delete the app, which removes the app and its related data. Depending on the app, you might be able to delete some of its documents and data. If your device shows a \"Storage Almost Full\" alert, check the storage recommendations or remove some content, such as videos and apps. Here's a list of the types of content on your device, and what each type includes: Apps: Installed apps and their content, and content stored in \"On My iPhone/iPad/iPod touch\" directory in the Files app, and Safari downloads.

Find out which macOS your Mac is using . Connect your device to your computer. Select your device in the sidebar of the Finder window or Apple Devices app. If using iTunes, select your device in the upper-left corner of the iTunes window. You'll see a bar that shows how much storage your content uses, divided by content type. Move your mouse over the bar to see how much storage each content type is using. Here's a list of the types of content on your device, and what each type includes: Audio: Songs, audio podcasts, audiobooks, voice memos, and ringtones. Video: Movies, music videos, and TV shows. Photos: Content in your Photo Library, Camera Roll, and Photo Stream. Apps: Installed apps. Documents & Data lists the content of the apps. Books: iBooks books, audio books, and PDF files.

Other: Settings, Siri voices, system data, and cached files. Synced content: Media content that you synchronize from your computer when you click Sync in the Finder window. 3 The Finder, Apple Devices app, and iTunes show cached music, videos, and photos as \"Other\" storage. The system creates these files when you stream or view content, allowing for faster access the next time you want to enjoy content. Your device removes these files when your device needs more space. Since the Finder, Apple Devices app, and iTunes categorize cached files as Other, reported usage for Music or Videos might differ. To view usage on your device, go to Settings > General > [Device] Storage. To free up space, your device removes cached and temporary files, so you don't have to. 1.

To use Live Translation: Listen to the other person speak. Your AirPods automatically translate what the person said to your preferred language. If you’re in a noisy environment, there is the added ability to use your iPhone's microphones in addition to those on AirPods to enhance the translation performance.

Use the Live tab in the Translate app on your iPhone to show a transcript to the person you’re speaking with, or press the Play button to play a translation on your iPhone speaker.

      "content": "Singapore Consumer Store Thanks for shopping at Apple. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the cool stuff we build. We also want to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at the Apple Online Store or on the phone with the Apple Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.) pagreem As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an Apple Store. We’ll be as brief as our attorneys will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or making a purchase at an Apple Store, you agree to the terms set forth below along with Apple’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use . Standard Return Policy We believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the Apple Store. In the unlikely event a product is not what you expected, you can return or exchange the product (not purchased in volume) with a receipt within 14 days of the date you receive the product from Apple. The product must be in its original condition with all of its included parts, accessories, and packaging and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based on the payment method. In addition, please note: For iPhone returns (not purchased in volume), here’s the important part: returning your iPhone may not automatically cancel or reset your wireless account; you are responsible for your wireless service agreement and for any applicable fees associated with your wireless account. Please contact your provider for more information. We will only remit refunds to a Singapore bank account where the name of the bank account holder matches the payor’s name/information. Please also note that we only remit refunds domestically and cannot remit refunds outside of Singapore. Products can be returned only in the country or region in which they were originally purchased. The following products are not eligible for return: electronic software downloads, subscriptions to the Software-Up-To-Date program and any Apple Developer products. Returned products may require inspection. If approved, a refund or exchange will be issued. Apple provides security features to enable you to protect your product in case of loss or theft. If you do not disable these features prior to returning your device, Apple may refuse the return or exchange. Opened software cannot be returned if it contained a seal with the software license on the outside of the package and you could read the software license before opening its packaging. As an exception, you may return Apple-branded software if you do not agree to the licensing terms; however, you may not retain or otherwise use any copies of returned software. It’s not legal . . . and it’s not nice. For complete details on how to return a product purchased at the Apple Store please visit the Returns & Refunds page . ZEISS Optical Inserts Returns ZEISS Optical Inserts - Prescription are custom, third-party products and may not be returned to an Apple Store location. Apple will accept returns on behalf of ZEISS within 14 days of the date you receive them. To return, sign in to your Order Listing page or call 1800-692-7753. ZEISS Optical Inserts - Readers can be returned to an Apple Store location. Apple will accept returns within 14 days of the date you receive them. To return, go to an Apple Store location, sign in to your Order Listing page or call 1800-692-7753. Return of Products Purchased in Volume In addition to the Standard Return Policy, the following applies to returns of any product purchased in volume (aggregate of more than 4 per order or across multiple orders) from the same product category: Must be returned within 7 days of the date you receive the product; Will be subject to a 25% restocking fee per item; and Must be returned to the Apple Store where originally purchased. iPhone Purchase The purchase and use of an iPhone is subject to terms and conditions found at: http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/ and http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/ . In addition, by purchasing an iPhone, you expressly acknowledge that: A wireless service plan is required to activate all iPhone features. Making unauthorized modifications to the software on an iPhone violates the iPhone software license agreement. The common term for modifying an iPhone is jail-breaking, with a particular emphasis on the second part of that term. That’s why we strongly, almost emphatically, recommend that you do not do so. Really. Should you be unable to use your iPhone due to an unauthorized software modification, its repair will not be covered under the warranty. Apple may, in its sole discretion, refuse or cancel any order and limit order quantity. Apple may require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order. Wireless Services Some Apple products utilize wireless services that may incur extra costs and are governed by the terms of a separate agreement between you and your selected wireless service provider. Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections With regards to pricing, Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the Apple Store at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment & Security page. Should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to contact the Apple Contact Center at 1800-692-7753 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events. Price protection is only available for up to 10 units of a particular product. Additionally, we may require that you have the product with you or otherwise have proof of possession when requesting price protection. Order Acceptance/Confirmation For Online and Call Center Purchases Once we receive your order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify Apple’s acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Apple Store reserves the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. If Apple cancels an order after you have already been billed, Apple will refund the billed amount. Shipping & Delivery Please review the Shipping & Pickup page to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the Apple Store. Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond Apple’s control once it leaves our facilities, Apple cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery. As Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, product(s) shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the product(s). Title in the product(s) shall pass to you when the product(s) is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Apple to resolve. In-Store Pickup and Return Apple offers in-store pickup for many of the items available on the Online Store. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and order number will be required for pickup. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. We’ll also send you a reminder or two, just in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Apple may cancel it. Please visit Shipping & Pickup for complete details about in-store pickup. Pickup Contact If you select in-store pickup, you may designate a third party to pick up your order. You must provide the name and email address of the third party. Please note that certain products and payment methods are not eligible for in-store pickup by a third party. The third party will need to bring a government issued photo ID and order number for pickup. Apple is not responsible for actions taken by the third party once your item(s) have been picked up. Shopping outside Singapore There are more than 35 Apple Online Stores in countries or regions around the globe. The Apple Online Store Singapore ships only within Singapore. We do not ship to freight forwarders. If you would like to purchase Apple products from outside Singapore, please see our International Store Directory to find out if an Apple Online Store serves your country or region. Consumers Only The Apple Store sells and ships products to end-user customers only. You may not purchase products at the Apple Store for resale, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we suspect you are doing so. And we’re pretty good at figuring that out . . . Singapore Sales Only The Apple Store accepts orders from billing addresses within Singapore. Apple will not ship products purchased at the Apple Store to an address outside of Singapore. Export This contract is subject to applicable export control laws. You may not export any product purchased from the Apple Store to another country or region if prohibited by export control laws. If you do plan to export an Apple product to another country or region, you must obtain any legally required export licences (or other government approvals) prior to doing so. Product Availability and Limitations Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some of our products, Apple may have to limit the number of products available for purchase. Trust us, we’re building them as fast as we can. Apple reserves the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order. Furthermore, there may be occasions when Apple confirms your order but subsequently learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, Apple will cancel the order and refund your purchase price in full.",

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you. Indemnity You agree to indemnify and hold Apple, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), made against Apple by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site.

Apple reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Apple deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Apple also may disclose your information when Apple determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.

You agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site and/or block your future access to the Site if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements or guidelines which may be associated with your use of the Site. You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Apple, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Apple obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Apple deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Apple may have at law or in equity.

          "content": "SALES & REFUND TERMS AND CONDITIONS (“TERMS”) Singapore Consumer Store Thanks for shopping at Apple. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the cool stuff we build. We also want to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at the Apple Online Store or on the phone with the Apple Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.) pagreem As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an Apple Store. We’ll be as brief as our attorneys will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or making a purchase at an Apple Store, you agree to the terms set forth below along with Apple’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use . Standard Return Policy We believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the Apple Store. In the unlikely event a product is not what you expected, you can return or exchange the product (not purchased in volume) with a receipt within 14 days of the date you receive the product from Apple. The product must be in its original condition with all of its included parts, accessories, and packaging and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based on the payment method. In addition, please note: For iPhone returns (not purchased in volume), here’s the important part: returning your iPhone may not automatically cancel or reset your wireless account; you are responsible for your wireless service agreement and for any applicable fees associated with your wireless account. Please contact your provider for more information. We will only remit refunds to a Singapore bank account where the name of the bank account holder matches the payor’s name/information. Please also note that we only remit refunds domestically and cannot remit refunds outside of Singapore. Products can be returned only in the country or region in which they were originally purchased. The following products are not eligible for return: electronic software downloads, subscriptions to the Software-Up-To-Date program and any Apple Developer products. Returned products may require inspection. If approved, a refund or exchange will be issued. Apple provides security features to enable you to protect your product in case of loss or theft. If you do not disable these features prior to returning your device, Apple may refuse the return or exchange. Opened software cannot be returned if it contained a seal with the software license on the outside of the package and you could read the software license before opening its packaging. As an exception, you may return Apple-branded software if you do not agree to the licensing terms; however, you may not retain or otherwise use any copies of returned software. It’s not legal . . . and it’s not nice. For complete details on how to return a product purchased at the Apple Store please visit the Returns & Refunds page . ZEISS Optical Inserts Returns ZEISS Optical Inserts - Prescription are custom, third-party products and may not be returned to an Apple Store location. Apple will accept returns on behalf of ZEISS within 14 days of the date you receive them. To return, sign in to your Order Listing page or call 1800-692-7753. ZEISS Optical Inserts - Readers can be returned to an Apple Store location. Apple will accept returns within 14 days of the date you receive them. To return, go to an Apple Store location, sign in to your Order Listing page or call 1800-692-7753. Return of Products Purchased in Volume In addition to the Standard Return Policy, the following applies to returns of any product purchased in volume (aggregate of more than 4 per order or across multiple orders) from the same product category: Must be returned within 7 days of the date you receive the product; Will be subject to a 25% restocking fee per item; and Must be returned to the Apple Store where originally purchased. iPhone Purchase The purchase and use of an iPhone is subject to terms and conditions found at: http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/ and http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/ . In addition, by purchasing an iPhone, you expressly acknowledge that: A wireless service plan is required to activate all iPhone features. Making unauthorized modifications to the software on an iPhone violates the iPhone software license agreement. The common term for modifying an iPhone is jail-breaking, with a particular emphasis on the second part of that term. That’s why we strongly, almost emphatically, recommend that you do not do so. Really. Should you be unable to use your iPhone due to an unauthorized software modification, its repair will not be covered under the warranty. Apple may, in its sole discretion, refuse or cancel any order and limit order quantity. Apple may require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order. Wireless Services Some Apple products utilize wireless services that may incur extra costs and are governed by the terms of a separate agreement between you and your selected wireless service provider. Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections With regards to pricing, Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the Apple Store at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment & Security page. Should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to contact the Apple Contact Center at 1800-692-7753 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events. Price protection is only available for up to 10 units of a particular product. Additionally, we may require that you have the product with you or otherwise have proof of possession when requesting price protection. Order Acceptance/Confirmation For Online and Call Center Purchases Once we receive your order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify Apple’s acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Apple Store reserves the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. If Apple cancels an order after you have already been billed, Apple will refund the billed amount. Shipping & Delivery Please review the Shipping & Pickup page to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the Apple Store. Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond Apple’s control once it leaves our facilities, Apple cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery. As Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, product(s) shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the product(s). Title in the product(s) shall pass to you when the product(s) is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Apple to resolve. In-Store Pickup and Return Apple offers in-store pickup for many of the items available on the Online Store. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and order number will be required for pickup. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. We’ll also send you a reminder or two, just in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Apple may cancel it. Please visit Shipping & Pickup for complete details about in-store pickup. Pickup Contact If you select in-store pickup, you may designate a third party to pick up your order. You must provide the name and email address of the third party. Please note that certain products and payment methods are not eligible for in-store pickup by a third party. The third party will need to bring a government issued photo ID and order number for pickup. Apple is not responsible for actions taken by the third party once your item(s) have been picked up. Shopping outside Singapore There are more than 35 Apple Online Stores in countries or regions around the globe. The Apple Online Store Singapore ships only within Singapore. We do not ship to freight forwarders. If you would like to purchase Apple products from outside Singapore, please see our International Store Directory to find out if an Apple Online Store serves your country or region. Consumers Only The Apple Store sells and ships products to end-user customers only. You may not purchase products at the Apple Store for resale, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we suspect you are doing so. And we’re pretty good at figuring that out . . . Singapore Sales Only The Apple Store accepts orders from billing addresses within Singapore. Apple will not ship products purchased at the Apple Store to an address outside of Singapore. Export This contract is subject to applicable export control laws. You may not export any product purchased from the Apple Store to another country or region if prohibited by export control laws. If you do plan to export an Apple product to another country or region, you must obtain any legally required export licences (or other government approvals) prior to doing so. Product Availability and Limitations Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some of our products, Apple may have to limit the number of products available for purchase. Trust us, we’re building them as fast as we can. Apple reserves the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order. Furthermore, there may be occasions when Apple confirms your order but subsequently learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, Apple will cancel the order and refund your purchase price in full.",

We also want to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at the Apple Online Store or on the phone with the Apple Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.) pagreem As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an Apple Store. We’ll be as brief as our attorneys will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or making a purchase at an Apple Store, you agree to the terms set forth below along with Apple’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use . Standard Return Policy We believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the Apple Store. In the unlikely event a product is not what you expected, you can return or exchange the product (not purchased in volume) with a receipt within 14 days of the date you receive the product from Apple. The product must be in its original condition with all of its included parts, accessories, and packaging and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based on the payment method. In addition, please note: For iPhone returns (not purchased in volume), here’s the important part: returning your iPhone may not automatically cancel or reset your wireless account; you are responsible for your wireless service agreement and for any applicable fees associated with your wireless account. Please contact your provider for more information. We will only remit refunds to a Singapore bank account where the name of the bank account holder matches the payor’s name/information. Please also note that we only remit refunds domestically and cannot remit refunds outside of Singapore. Products can be returned only in the country or region in which they were originally purchased. The following products are not eligible for return: electronic software downloads, subscriptions to the Software-Up-To-Date program and any Apple Developer products. Returned products may require inspection. If approved, a refund or exchange will be issued. Apple provides security features to enable you to protect your product in case of loss or theft. If you do not disable these features prior to returning your device, Apple may refuse the return or exchange. Opened software cannot be returned if it contained a seal with the software license on the outside of the package and you could read the software license before opening its packaging. As an exception, you may return Apple-branded software if you do not agree to the licensing terms; however, you may not retain or otherwise use any copies of returned software. It’s not legal . . . and it’s not nice. For complete details on how to return a product purchased at the Apple Store please visit the Returns & Refunds page . ZEISS Optical Inserts Returns ZEISS Optical Inserts - Prescription are custom, third-party products and may not be returned to an Apple Store location. Apple will accept returns on behalf of ZEISS within 14 days of the date you receive them. To return, sign in to your Order Listing page or call 1800-692-7753. ZEISS Optical Inserts - Readers can be returned to an Apple Store location. Apple will accept returns within 14 days of the date you receive them. To return, go to an Apple Store location, sign in to your Order Listing page or call 1800-692-7753. Return of Products Purchased in Volume In addition to the Standard Return Policy, the following applies to returns of any product purchased in volume (aggregate of more than 4 per order or across multiple orders) from the same product category: Must be returned within 7 days of the date you receive the product; Will be subject to a 25% restocking fee per item; and Must be returned to the Apple Store where originally purchased. iPhone Purchase The purchase and use of an iPhone is subject to terms and conditions found at: http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/ and http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/ . In addition, by purchasing an iPhone, you expressly acknowledge that: A wireless service plan is required to activate all iPhone features. Making unauthorized modifications to the software on an iPhone violates the iPhone software license agreement. The common term for modifying an iPhone is jail-breaking, with a particular emphasis on the second part of that term. That’s why we strongly, almost emphatically, recommend that you do not do so. Really. Should you be unable to use your iPhone due to an unauthorized software modification, its repair will not be covered under the warranty. Apple may, in its sole discretion, refuse or cancel any order and limit order quantity. Apple may require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order. Wireless Services Some Apple products utilize wireless services that may incur extra costs and are governed by the terms of a separate agreement between you and your selected wireless service provider. Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections With regards to pricing, Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the Apple Store at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment & Security page. Should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to contact the Apple Contact Center at 1800-692-7753 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events. Price protection is only available for up to 10 units of a particular product. Additionally, we may require that you have the product with you or otherwise have proof of possession when requesting price protection. Order Acceptance/Confirmation For Online and Call Center Purchases Once we receive your order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify Apple’s acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Apple Store reserves the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. If Apple cancels an order after you have already been billed, Apple will refund the billed amount. Shipping & Delivery Please review the Shipping & Pickup page to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the Apple Store. Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond Apple’s control once it leaves our facilities, Apple cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery. As Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, product(s) shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the product(s). Title in the product(s) shall pass to you when the product(s) is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Apple to resolve. In-Store Pickup and Return Apple offers in-store pickup for many of the items available on the Online Store. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and order number will be required for pickup. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. We’ll also send you a reminder or two, just in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Apple may cancel it. Please visit Shipping & Pickup for complete details about in-store pickup. Pickup Contact If you select in-store pickup, you may designate a third party to pick up your order. You must provide the name and email address of the third party. Please note that certain products and payment methods are not eligible for in-store pickup by a third party. The third party will need to bring a government issued photo ID and order number for pickup. Apple is not responsible for actions taken by the third party once your item(s) have been picked up. Shopping outside Singapore There are more than 35 Apple Online Stores in countries or regions around the globe. The Apple Online Store Singapore ships only within Singapore. We do not ship to freight forwarders. If you would like to purchase Apple products from outside Singapore, please see our International Store Directory to find out if an Apple Online Store serves your country or region. Consumers Only The Apple Store sells and ships products to end-user customers only. You may not purchase products at the Apple Store for resale, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we suspect you are doing so. And we’re pretty good at figuring that out . . . Singapore Sales Only The Apple Store accepts orders from billing addresses within Singapore. Apple will not ship products purchased at the Apple Store to an address outside of Singapore. Export This contract is subject to applicable export control laws. You may not export any product purchased from the Apple Store to another country or region if prohibited by export control laws. If you do plan to export an Apple product to another country or region, you must obtain any legally required export licences (or other government approvals) prior to doing so. Product Availability and Limitations Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some of our products, Apple may have to limit the number of products available for purchase. Trust us, we’re building them as fast as we can. Apple reserves the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order. Furthermore, there may be occasions when Apple confirms your order but subsequently learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, Apple will cancel the order and refund your purchase price in full.",
