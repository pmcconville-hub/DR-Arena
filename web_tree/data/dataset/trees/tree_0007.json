  "content": "NYFA Producing How To's Mastering the 7 Stages of Film Production December 12, 2023 The stages of film production involve a meticulous progression, starting with pre-production tasks such as script selection, casting, and securing resources. Transitioning into the production phase, the focus shifts to rehearsals, set design, and technical preparations, leading ultimately to the final stage of post-production, where the performance is refined, polished, and presented to the audience, showcasing the culmination of creative efforts and collaborative teamwork. Mastering the 7 Stages of Film Production Development The development period belongs to the project producer, who starts gathering the ideas for the film- rights from books, plays, etc. if needed- until the final draft of the screenplay is completed. During this time, a first synopsis is done, which will help the lead producer sell the idea and raise funds. Often, storyboards and other visual aids will be drafted to accompany the script and help the producer communicate the essence of the film. Financing Networking and making meetings, often in Los Angeles and, to a lesser extent, New York, is how many producers will meet with possible financiers. Additionally, a lot of producers travel to festivals, both domestic and international, to show the project materials to possible investors. Pre-production With enough funding, pre-production can begin, starting with selecting the cast, crew, locations of the shoot, building of sets and props, etc. Shot lists are put together, and the producer starts working on a schedule for the entire shoot, starting broad and getting more specific as production begins to ramp up. Production The assistant director (AD) shines during production as the footage is filmed by coordinating all the different teams simultaneously. Actors, possibly after days or weeks of rehearsing, finally shoot their scenes as the production crew–grips, lighting, sound, camera, etc. work hard to make every second count and shot look as great as possible. Writers and producers may be on set, but the director is calling all the shots creatively–with their AD making sure they’re sticking to the schedule and getting the footage they need before it’s time to move on. Post-production This is where the editor comes into play, and if the budget is big enough, visual effects teams. In collaboration with the director, editors assemble takes and shots and create a linear film based on hours of footage. For bigger productions, teasers can be done during this time to start marketing. A music composer comes in to orchestrate the score of the movie as the final cut begins to loom. Sound design and color direction are important elements during this time and culminate in picture lock–the film’s final edit. Marketing In the case of a major production company, teasers are already out to promote the film’s release date. In other scenarios, promotional posters, festival screenings, and social media are best to help generate buzz for the film. If the production is small, the creatives involved with the film may have to wear this hat whether they like it or not, though producers can outsource to small marketing companies that do this for a living. Distribution Theatrical distribution is typically divided between domestic and international and involves agreements with production companies to pay for the film to screen at physical theatres. Previously, producers would also concentrate their efforts on how the films would be made into physical copies of VHS, DVD, or Blu-Ray and make deals with video rental chains, but nowadays, streaming is king. While smaller filmmakers may try to get on as many platforms as possible–Amazon Video, Hulu, Netflix, etc.–getting an exclusive deal with a single platform may be more lucrative, especially if it comes with promotion on the platform’s end. Hand in hand with marketing, promotion for the film during its release is also key, including press interviews, red carpet premieres, and other launch parties. Produce Your Own Films and TV Shows At NYFA New York Film Academy’s focus is equipping students to produce compelling films and television shows. Whether it’s film, television, web series, podcasts, or any other medium you can imagine, you’ll have a chance to tell your story under the guidance of some of the best creatives in the industry.

Salary subsidies, assistive technology, non-paid work experiences, and special employer incentives may be available from VA to help you hire those who have served. Explore what VA offers to make hiring or rehiring a Veteran with a service-connected disability that much easier. For example, under the Non-Paid Work Experience (NPWE) program, federal, state, and local government agencies may become NPWE employers at no cost to them.

March 15 to May 15, 2025, was open season for the Yellow Ribbon Program for the 2025-2026 academic year. During open season, schools may apply for initial participation, modify existing open-ended agreements, take no action, and continue to honor the terms of existing open-ended agreements, or withdraw from the Yellow Ribbon Program. The Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program (Yellow Ribbon Program) is a provision of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. This program allows institutions of higher learning (degree granting institutions) in the United States to voluntarily enter into an agreement with VA to fund tuition expenses that exceed either the annual maximum cap for private institutions or the resident tuition and fees for a public institution. The institution can contribute up to 50% of those expenses and VA will match the same amount as the institution. The Institution of Higher Learning (IHL) must agree to: Provide contributions to eligible individuals who apply for the Yellow Ribbon Program on a first-come first-served basis, regardless of the rate at which the individual is pursuing training in any given academic year; Provide contributions during the current academic year and all subsequent academic years in which the IHL is participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program and the student maintains satisfactory progress, conduct, and attendance; Make contributions toward the program on behalf of the individual in the form of a grant, scholarship, etc; State the dollar amount that will be contributed for each participant during the academic year; State the maximum number of individuals for whom contributions will be made in any given academic year. Veterans and dependents receiving the maximum benefit rate, including those on the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship , may be eligible for this funding. Effective August 1, 2022, active-duty service members also can participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program. return to top",
