  "content": "The Craft of Writing • Mar 31, 2022 An Insider’s Guide to Fanfiction Learn the history of fanfiction, common tropes, and get tips on how to write your own. Cat Webling When I say “fanfiction,” what’s the first thing that comes to mind? A giggly teenage girl at her laptop, writing blushworthy One Direction fanfics? A high school nerd tearing apart a story’s plot holes and fixing them himself? A certain queen of darkness? Fanfiction has long been seen as something that only teen girls or weird men write, or as poorly written love and/or sex stories. In reality, the world of fanfiction is insanely rich, with a longstanding history of excellent stories told by aspiring (or even professional) authors of all backgrounds and presented to a community that’s more than willing to love a piece of work beyond the limits presented in the official storyline. If you’ve never considered fanfiction beyond the stereotypes, or if you’re considering writing it but aren’t sure where to start, I’ll be happy to bring you into my fan-community world, and explain fan(tastic) fiction and where to find it. What is fanfiction? Fanfiction is, in the simplest of terms, a piece of fiction based on another piece of media, such as books, TV shows, or video games. It typically uses key elements from its source material such as settings, characters, and overarching storylines, though it repurposes them into an original plot. Fanfiction, as the name implies, is usually written by someone who admires the source material, and is an expression of that admiration. The history of fanfiction It might shock you to find out that fanfiction has actually been written and enjoyed for centuries. If I’m going to be extremely literal in the definition, then one of the earliest examples we have of fanfiction is Dante Alighieri’s The Divine Comedy. It is, after all, a direct retelling of the Bible’s teachings, featuring key religious, political, and literary figures throughout and following the author’s self-insert on his journey. Even if you’re a bit more strict with the idea of fanfiction, you’d be hard-pressed not to include lots of works from at least the 18th century on. An early example is Old Friends and New Fancies by Sybil G. Brinton, a retelling of Jane Austen’s novels which centered around popular characters including the likes of the Darcys and Bennets, as well as Mary Crawford and Tom Bertram. The novel follows some of the supporting characters from the original books, exploring their stories after the events described by Austen. It was hugely popular when it was published in 1913, and continues to be read today. If we want to get into the nitty-gritty of what fanfiction consists of, then we might narrow it down to having come from the first modern fandom, which centered around one of the most popular series ever written: the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle released the famous detective’s stories as regular contributions to The Strand Magazine, a popular periodical in London. They were a hit from the very beginning and grew so popular that communities began to pop up to celebrate the works around the world, with the two biggest being centered in London and New York. These communities would publish “pastiches,” or their own mini-periodicals containing stories written by members centering on cases solved by Holmes which frequently included real people like the author or popular politicians (who were sometimes one and the same!). All of that being said, fans themselves didn’t start using the term “fanfiction” until around the 1960s, when Star Trek hit the air and blew up in popularity. The scifi community was already well known for being outlandish and uniquely accepting of fan contributions, so it wasn’t a huge surprise when the fans started their own magazines to keep in touch with each other. These independently published “fanzines” featured fun facts about the show, interviews with the cast and crew, information about events and conventions, and, of course, stories written by fans for other fans. The most popular of these fanzines was Spockanalia , created by Gene Roddenberry and DC Fontana in 1967. It was a high-quality magazine; some of the writers featured in it went on to write for the real show! Fanfiction really hit the public eye with the dawn of the internet in the late 90s and early 2000s. Fans from all over the world could share their works with each other with the click of a button, spawning a unique subculture that carried its own slang and communal expectations. Now, there are millions of fics for thousands of fandoms across hundreds of dedicated sites. The benefits of fanfiction Fanfiction is an excellent playground for the new writer. Most fanfic authors either are very young or got their start that way; it’s typical to see stories written by enthusiasts as young as ten or eleven. These kids are developing their writing skills outside of school projects, potentially for the first time, and have found an excellent place to do that. But what makes fanfiction such a good place to start? Firstly, fanfiction writers are drawing from existing franchises rather than creating their own entirely new worlds. This is helpful when you’re first starting out, as it allows you to focus on other parts of the story - creating a plot, exploring new perspectives, drafting dialogue, etc. Working with “premade” characters, settings, and lore means that you don’t have to spend as much time on exposition, character development, and worldbuilding, all of which are daunting prospects for someone who’s never written outside of a creative writing class. Coming off of that, fanfiction allows writers to dive into their stories deeply. Because the original media tells the major stories - plots to save the universe, world-ending catastrophes, and elaborate schemes from major threats to society - fanfiction can cover the much smaller aspects of the world. Most fanfiction tells the story of a small handful of characters; some follow only one character in a single scene. The writer can explore some of the moments that are glossed over in the larger work - what was Leia thinking as she watched Alderron explode? Do Sam and Dean have any traditions when they’re driving to the next hunting job? How did John spend the first few days after Sherlock died? Are the Tenth Doctor and Rose enjoying their life in the alternate world? They can take the time to really get to know these characters, and to show them growing and learning from small, everyday events. Fanfiction can be seen as a kind of creative literary analysis. On top of this, fanfiction is a great way to engage in a community that you already love and build one of your own. There are other fans just like you who are also excited to see the further adventures of characters they’ve become attached to, and are happy to chat with you about what those adventures might be. Fanfiction writers love to collaborate, creating interesting writing challenges and themed weeks of writing so that they can not only contribute, but read the works of others and celebrate the media they’ve devoted themselves to. You don’t get famous from writing fanfiction, it’s true (well, most of the time), but you can gain a following of your own by creating for an established community. Beyond this, fanfiction helps writers do the one thing that will improve their writing dramatically: practice. Every fic you write is another chance to refine your writing style, practice getting a first draft to paper, discover new editing techniques that pull the story together, establish a regular routine for publication, and filter and accept feedback on your writing. It’s always going to be true that the more you write and revise, the better you’re going to get at writing. If you want to write original stories, but don’t know where to start, fanfiction is a great way to explore and expand your skillset. The best thing about fanfiction is that it’s fun! You don’t have to write it with the goal of getting rich, famous, or ridiculously talented. You can write fanfiction for the sheer joy of it, throwing your favorite characters into situations of your own design. I know that when I was a young teen, my friends and I would swap fic through text messages just because it made us giggle and smile, and would lead to fantastic conversations. Writing stories might relieve the tension of a long work day, cheer you up when you’re feeling down, or simply fill time when you’re bored. It’s a free pastime that requires nothing more than the willingness to say “what if?” Potential drawbacks of fanfiction As with almost anything else, there are definite drawbacks to fanfiction writing. Most obviously, fanfiction doesn’t often teach you how to create original characters and worlds. Using a preset character is great, but it doesn’t help you understand how to make your own characters, from scratch, and fill them out into multi-dimensional people that are interesting to read about. Additionally, fanfiction doesn’t usually involve the kind of troubleshooting for lore that traditional story building does; if you can just look at the Wiki to solve your plot hole, are you really learning how to solve a plot hole? It’s also frequently posted unedited, one first draft after another, and while there’s nothing particularly wrong with that, it does mean that you’re not getting in the editing practice that you need in order to actively improve as a writer. High expectations from your readership for frequent updates might even encourage you to skip the editing process to get the next part of your story out as fast as possible, which can lead to an increase in negative feedback, or getting no feedback at all. For new writers especially, this can be incredibly disheartening. Of course, this isn’t a universal rule - there are definitely fanfiction writers who create original characters (OCs) and invent new lore - but it is something to think about if you consider transitioning to original fiction. The biggest potential drawback of fanfiction is the stigma surrounding it. Fanfiction writers are often seen as lesser; they’re “not real writers” because their work isn’t wholly original. It’s still relatively taboo to attach fanfiction to your real name, and can be incredibly embarrassing when you’re “outed” to people in your real life who don’t understand the fan community you’re a part of, or fandom culture in general. Fanfiction writers are mocked and berated fairly frequently, by those who consider the genre to be illegitimate or think of it as nothing but sex stories written by teens. This reductive view means that some young writers are actively discouraged from writing these stories out of fear of the reactions they might get. Writing fanfiction I hope that, having read this far, you’re at least a little interested in reading some fanfiction. Even if you’re not into creating it, fanfiction can be a great read when you’re enjoying a new piece of media and run out of official material to obsess over - whoops, I mean, enjoy in a normal and healthy amount. If, however, you’ve come to this article because you’re interested in getting started writing fanfics of your own, I do have a few tips for you. Read fanfiction The best advice an author can give to an aspiring writer is also the most basic advice in every single how-to-write guide: read, read, read. This is the best possible thing you can do to start writing. Read some of the most popular fics in your community. Read some of the newest ones. Read bad fics, emotional fics, fics that don’t seem to end, or short stories that are 200 words long. Read everything you can and get an idea for what fanfiction generally looks and sounds like. On top of being a general good tip for writing, it’ll also help you get familiar with the community so that, when you do have a piece you want to publish, you’ll already have a good sense for where you want to publish it and how to get it in front of readers. Here are some of my favorite fanfic reads for you to enjoy in your research: Twist and Shout by standbyme and gabriel on AO3. This absolutely heartbreaking fic is from the Supernatural fandom, and is a Dean/Cas love story. Set in the 1960s, it’s a story of love and loss during the Vietnam war. My Immortal by XXXbloodyrists666XXX. This is by far the most infamous piece of fanfiction ever written. I’m not recommending it because it’s good, but because it’s so hilariously bad that it’s become the longest running joke in fandom. This piece on its own is worth a deep dive, so if you’re interested in that, you can learn more here . Ten Times The Doctor Didn’t Say I Love You by cenowar. This is a very classic trope in fanfiction (more on that below) and a very cute rendition of it for the Doctor Who fandom. This set of headcanons by nonasuch on Tumblr. It’s a fascinating look at what might have happened if Harry Potter had been adopted by a loving couple rather than raised by the Dursleys. Ask “what if?” Fanfiction is, by its very nature, speculative, which means that every piece of fanfiction starts with this very simple question: What if? What if this happened? What if this didn’t happen? What if this character and this character got together? What if everything changed? What if we knew what happened next? Ask yourself “what if” questions about your chosen media, and follow the most interesting answer. Once you’ve picked your favorite simple version of the question, start asking questions again. Think about how the answer to that “what if” affects the rest of the story - do the characters change? Their relationships? The setting? This will help you build out your plot more effectively. Understand the lingo Fandom as a whole practically has a language of its own. As a subculture developing both offline and on for about two centuries now, it’s bound to develop some linguistic quirks, and you’ll need to understand them if you’re going to write fanfiction. Here are some of the key words in the fandom dictionary that you’ll need to know. Canon is the description used for the story that happened in the original media. If it’s on the page or on the screen, it’s canon. Headcanons are the stories made up by the fans. They might be about the lore of the world or individual characters’ habits. Fanon is a headcanon that’s held by a large portion of the fandom, but isn’t actually canon. OOC means Out of Character. It’s a general warning that someone in the fic is going to act in an unexpected way that doesn’t match their in-media representation. OC is an Original Character (yes, confusing, I know) made up by the fic author. Slash fiction / Femslash / Yuri / Yaoi - Slash fiction is a subgenre within fanfiction characterized by intimate / romantic relationships between characters of the same sex. Femslash & Yuri indicate relationships between females, while yaoi refers to males. Besides fan fiction stories, these tropes are common in fan art. Example pairings include Kirk/Spock, Dean/Cas, Draco/Hermione, etc. Ships are relationships between characters, typically referred to with a portmontu of the characters’ names. For instance, Dean/Cas becomes Destiel. Crossovers are combinations of two different franchises or author styles into a single story. Star Wars meets Star Trek. Shakespeare, as written by J.K.Rowling. These terms are great for when you’re tagging. I suggest paying attention to the tags when you’re reading fic for research, and seeing how they might apply to your work. Pick a trope Tropes are scenarios or relationships that recur often in writing. While present in every genre, in fanfiction, tropes are king. The entire concept of fanfiction is based on wish fulfillment; it makes sense that common themes would start to develop. Some of the most popular in fanfiction are: Enemies-to-lovers is a trope that revolves around two characters who seem to hate each other slowly learning that they actually love each other. Think Han and Leia. Alternate universes (AUs) are when you take familiar characters and put them in an unfamiliar setting or situation. This might look like shifting the story in time, taking it to a different location, or adding in an element like magic that wasn’t there before. Think The Legend of Zelda, but taking place in the modern day. The Lord of the Rings, but it’s science fiction. Redemption arcs are when evil characters realize the error of their ways and get to come back to the good side. Zuko from Avatar the Last Airbender, anyone? Temporary amnesia is either a hilarious or heartbreaking trope which involves a character being injured and forgetting who they are for a short period of time. This trope is actually a fairly old one, and is used widely in anime and manga. Body swapping is a usually very funny trope that involves two characters somehow swapping bodies and having to figure out how to swap back. This is essentially the fandom version of Freaky Friday. Soulmates are two characters who are fated to be together, usually romantically. “There was only one bed” is a slash fic trope in which two characters are forced to share a hotel room which has only one bed, and thereby realize that they’ve got feelings for each other. I’m not sure if there’s a regular media equivalent for this, but it’s one of the most popular tropes in the entirety of fanfiction, to the point of lovingly being made fun of in the community. “X times Y happened and one time it didn’t” revolves around near-misses and the resolution of those near misses. A character might be narrowly avoiding death only to go down tragically, or two characters might be dancing around each other before eventually falling in love. There are hundreds and hundreds of tropes you can choose from; find one that you like and research it to find out the norms of the stories that you might want to incorporate into your plot. Pick a platform There are lots of excellent platforms and forums that you can use to share your fanfiction. Here are some of the best. Archive of Our Own (affectionately nicknamed AO3) is run by fans, for fans. It was created in an effort to keep a free and safe space for fanfic writers as publishers and the owners of various content cracked down on other fandom spaces (more on that below). It’s home to hundreds of thousands of fics for nearly every fandom under the sun, and is known for having one of the best tagging systems on the internet. Wattpad was originally on the same level as other early fanfiction sites in that it had very basic word processing, tagging, and sorting. As the years have gone on, however, the site has upgraded tremendously; you can now sort fic into collections, tag it according to fandom and character accurately, and create a whole author profile. It’s also a great site for original fiction, and even includes its own publishing press! Fanfiction.net is an old school fanfiction site. Its tagging system is similar to that of AO3, though far less advanced, and its layout is ridiculously simple. That being said, it’s not as active and lively as other sites, and doesn’t have many added features. Tumblr is the classic fandom blog website. Its posting interface is fantastic, allowing for multimedia posts containing text, images, videos, and audio, as well as external linking. Blogs are totally customizable and the tagging system (if you take the time to research it) means that your fic is easy to find. Unfortunately, it’s also a site known for its constant glitching and unruly userbase who frequently harass newcomers. Be careful who you follow, and be liberal with the block button. Laterpress is, of course, a fantastic place to post your fanfiction. With personalized author profiles and easy-to-maintain story collections, along with a fantastic word processor and audience building tools, you’ve got everything you need to yell at the world about your favorite ship. See below for more information about fair use, and remember that fan fiction published on Laterpress cannot be monetized. Fanfiction and copyright One of the most important and controversial parts of writing fanfiction is knowing where you stand legally. The legality of fan-created media has been hotly debated by writers, readers, publishers, and many others since the genre’s inception, and the most hotly debated part is how fanfiction factors into copyright law. ‍ Copyright is the legal protection of a property that assigns rights to the copyright holder. According to United States copyright law, works of literature, music, drama, graphic art, sculpture, choreography, and architectural law, as well as motion pictures and sound recordings among a few other specifics, can be protected via copyright. Copyright is automatically assigned to the original creator of the work, and includes the exclusive right to: Reproduce and distribute copies of the work, both for free and for profit Display or perform the work publicly Prepare derivative works based on the original work Here’s where things get tricky. Remember how I mentioned exclusive right? That means that anyone else who tries to do any of that is in serious legal trouble, and can be sued for breach of copyright by the original creator. Because fanfiction by definition pulls characters and settings from another piece of media, it can be considered a derivative work, and therefore many believe it to be a breach of copyright. Without the express permission of the copyright holder, fanfiction can be seen as plagiarism, and, if the work is ever monetized, fraud. Fair use in fanfiction So, if fanfiction is banned by copyright law, how has the genre survived? This is where the concept of fair use comes into play. Fair use is defined by the copyright office of the United States as “a legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances.” According to them, there are four deciding factors that determine whether a work is considered fair use. The purpose of the use . Works that are not-for-profit, non-commercial, or educational can be considered fair use. The nature of the use. Using a creative work is less likely to qualify as fair use than using a factual work. The amount of the original work used . The more of the original work used, the less likely you are to be covered by fair use. The effect of the use on the original work’s market or value. Works that do not detract from the market value or market availability for the original work can be covered by fair use. Obviously, fanfiction faces some issues with these factors, as they’re pulled from fiction and use a pretty significant portion of that fiction. So, there are a few things you need to remember when creating fanfiction. Never, under any circumstances, try to monetize your fanfiction. You can accept donations, you can monetize other works and link them at the end of your fanfics, but you can’t monetize a fanfic. No ads, no pay-to-read, no selling them as a book. Making it commercially viable requires changing character names, settings, and other story details so significantly that the story no longer resembles the source material it was built from. Fanfiction writers refer to this as “ filing off the serial numbers. ” The most famous example of this is probably E.L. James, who turned her Twilight fanfiction into the Fifty Shades of Grey series. Make sure your story is transformative rather than derivative. Transformative works of fanfiction tell a new story with the same characters or setting. Derivative fanfiction just tells the same story again, in slightly different words. This is why asking “what if” is so important. Search to see if the copyright holder has a standing policy on fanfiction and other fan works. Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, for instance, gave public statements saying that as long as they don’t have to read it, they don’t mind fanfiction being written. On the same coin, opposite side: do not write for fandoms that have been explicitly banned from creating fic. The most notable fandom like this is that of Anne Rice, who always vehemently fought against the use of her characters in any fiction other than her own. Never try to claim your work as official. Make it very clear that this is a fanfiction, written for fun, and not endorsed by the original creator. This is usually pretty easy; add the tags for your fandom and post on a common fanfiction website. It’s not necessary, but adding a disclaimer that acknowledges the original copyright holder is always a good move. Legally, it doesn’t do anything, but it does prevent anyone from assuming you’ve plagiarized. Conclusion Fanfiction is a very cool genre. It’s a public expression of your adoration for a work, and an invitation to have a conversation with it. Fanfiction writers know the source media ridiculously well - they have to in order to tear it apart and reform it - and they’re almost always excited to talk about that media with other fans. Whole communities have sprung up around the creation of fan media, and grown from a few people nervously submitting to ‘zines to whole sites celebrating this amazing creative endeavor. Whether you’re writing it for yourself, sharing it with others, or simply reading it, fanfiction is a powerful thing, and it should be celebrated as such. Give it a try, if you haven’t already, and you might find yourself with some new favorite stories, writers to follow, and ideas to get your pen to paper.",

          "content": "Help Center • Jan 25, 2022 Laterpress 101: Guide to getting started Thinking about signing up for Laterpress? Here's everything you need to know before getting started. Scott Kelly What is Laterpress? In a nutshell, Laterpress is a free way for authors to publish directly to–and make money directly from–readers via their own author website. That's right: we take 0% on all direct payments authors receive from readers (compared to the 35% to 70% cut taken by traditional digital booksellers). Better yet, because authors can publish via their own website, readers form a direct connection with the authors they love, not with a company or marketplace. This gives each author freedom from any one platform or bookseller. How does it work? So what does publishing via Laterpress actually look like? Let’s walk you through some of our core features: 1. Publish to your own website Laterpress lets you publish your books and serials to your own branded subdomain (like https://iliad.laterpress.com ) or even a custom domain of your own ( https://planargates.nategillick.com ). With your branding front and center, you can build a direct relationship with readers: If you decide to use a completely custom domain to host your stories, the best part is your readers don’t even have to know Laterpress exists. And if you ever stop using Laterpress as your publishing platform, you can host your new stories on the same website URL as always. With central platforms like Wattpad and Kindle, that simply isn’t possible. If you decide to leave those platforms, you risk losing the readership you’ve spent months or even years growing. With Laterpress, authors never again have to choose between their independence and their readers. 2. Sell your books as epubs... and web-native experiences Laterpress makes it easy to sell your book as a downloadable epub file for readers that prefer e-reader devices. We also let you offer a version of your book that is accessible directly via the web. These web-native books have been engineered from the ground up to meet the expectations of book and web serial readers. For example, your readers can navigate within chapters by swiping from page to page or by using a slidebar: Readers can also jump between chapters using your book’s automatically-generated table of contents: And they can customize their reading expirience with different fonts, line spacing, and themes: Laterpress also automatically saves each reader's place in your book so they can return to your website whenever they want and pick up reading right where they left off. 3. Charge what and how you want Instead of forcing readers to jump over to Paypal to pay for your books, Laterpress makes it easy for readers to read and pay for your book all in the same place: All you have to do to get started is create a Stripe account, connect it to Laterpress, and decide how you want to charge your readers. If you want to give your readers a free preview of your book, you can set the number of chapters they get access to. You also have flexibility over how you charge readers, with three different payment options: Entire book fee: You can charge readers a single price for access to your entire book. Chapter bundle fee: You can charge your readers a fee to unlock a certain number of chapters at a time. (This is a great option for authors of web serials in particular.) Subscription fee: You can charge your readers an annual subscription fee to access all of the books you publish on Laterpress. Authors can even offer readers a choice between the options above: for example, between a book fee to purchase one book from you or a subscription to get all of your content. It’s completely your choice as the author. 4. Release your book all at once… or serially Some of the best stories are the ones told serially over years and years. But current book publishing technology (like static ebook files) makes serial publishing hard. With Laterpress, we’ve changed that. You can add new chapters to your book whenever you want with just a few clicks: And your readers can receive automatic email notifications whenever new content is available so they always stay up to date: 5. Gather insights about readers Laterpress gives you the tools you need to understand your readers. You can view high-level metrics or download a report that tells you what chapters people are reading and where they might be dropping off: And because Laterpress integrates with your Stripe account, you can also log into your dashboard and see a detailed breakdown of how much you’re earning and how those earnings are trending over time. 6. Build a mailing list… and community Whenever readers create an account on Laterpress, they are asked if they want to sign up to your mailing list: That means every visitor to your book is an opportunity for a direct and enduring relationship with a reader, not just for a one-off transaction. Simply export your reader list from Latepress into a newsletter service like Mailchimp or ConvertKit and you can start communicating directly with readers today. 7. Control the platform you publish on The conundrum many authors today face is that technology platforms are often essential to building a career in books, but as those platforms grow and investor demands increase, the platforms often make unilateral changes that benefit the company at the expense of authors. Maybe the company hikes fees from 10% to 20%, or they change their algorithm to prioritize more lucrative content. Whatever the change–the authors responsible for growing the platform in the first place don’t even have a voice or a seat at the table. At Laterpress, we’re building a new kind of platform. Not only are we flipping the traditional script on publishing and helping authors go direct to their readers, but we’re giving authors a direct say in how Laterpress is run. We’re doing this by creating a first-of-its-kind platform constitution voted on by user delegates to help determine important issues like platform fees, content guidelines, and more. Does Laterpress help readers discover authors? Yes! Laterpress offers optional Author Community features that authors can opt in or out of. These features are designed to help you grow your readership. What does Laterpress cost? Publishing on Laterpress is completely free and we keep 0% of any direct payments you collect from readers. Our third party payment processor, Stripe, charges a small additional fee (roughly 2.9% - 3.4% + 30¢), and you keep the rest. In addition to free support for direct payments, Laterpress offers optional Author Community features that help readers discover authors. When readers purchase a book or subscribe as a result of Author Community features (e.g. because of referrals from affiliate links or recommendations), Laterpress charges a maximum fee of 15% in addition to Stripe's payment processing fees. What happens if I leave Laterpress? We believe that leaving a platform should be easy. That’s why we’ve designed Laterpress so you can take everything with you — your books, subscriptions, and mailing list — with no strings attached. With Laterpress's free custom domain functionality, authors can even leave Laterpress while keeping their website URL. Making leaving Laterpress easy for our users is a way for us to ensure that authors are sticking with us for the right reasons. Not because we’ve locked them into our proprietary payment system or because we’ve co-opted your readers but because we’ve built the best toolkit for direct book publishing. That's our mission. ‍ ‍",

Scott Kelly Summary This article provides an overview of Author Community features. These features are designed to help grow your readership via referrals from authors, readers, and the Laterpress platform. By default, Author Community features are enabled for your account. To turn them off, just go to the Settings page of your author dashboard and toggle them off. When a reader purchases your story or subscribes to you as a result of an Author Community referral, we assess a referral fee in addition to our standard fees . To learn everything you need to know about Author Community features, including how they work, how to participate, and what fees apply, read below. How do Author Community features work? There are two ways Author Community features will work at launch: Recommendations: When a reader finishes reading a story or goes to their bookshelf while on the Laterpress website of User A, the reader sees a \"Recommended\" section that displays stories by other authors that the reader might like. If the reader then clicks on a \"Recommended\" story of User B and purchases the story or a subscription to User B within 365 days, the transaction counts as an Author Community referral from User A to User B. Affiliate Links: When User A is reading a story by User B, User A can navigate to the menu of the book and copy the \"Affiliate Link\". The user can then share this link when promoting the story (for example, on a review blog or on social media). If another reader clicks on the link and purchases the story or a subscription to User B within 365 days, the transaction counts as an Author Community referral from User A to User B. Recommendations and Affiliate Links are just the first two Author Community features we're releasing. We also have plans to create Author Community features like curated listings and search tools that readers can use to find exactly the stories they want. How do you use Author Community features? To use Author Community features, you must have them enabled via the Settings page on your Author Dashboard. Enabling them means your stories will show up in the \"Recommended\" section of other authors' stories. If you receive a payment attributable to a referral, the payment will have the Author Community fee applied. You can also EARN money from the referrals that you make -- either via the \"Recommended\" sections of your stories or through Affiliate Links you share. To receive your portion of Author Community fees collected on referrals (discussed in detail below), at the time of the qualifying purchase you must have: (1) a Stripe account connected and (2) Author Community features enabled. What are the Author Community fees? Reader payments attributable to Author Community features are typically subject to a 15% fee in addition to Stripe's payment processing fees. This 15% fee applies even when the reader has purchased from the author before. 5% goes to the user who made the referral (e.g. via an affiliate link or their recommended section) and 10% goes to Laterpress. That's right! It's not just Laterpress as a platform that makes money from recommendations; the user who made the recommendation earns money, too. If no author recommended the book but the purchase was attributable to Author Community features (for example, Laterpress recommends your book via a curated list or a user discovers your book via platform search features), the fee is only 10% and goes entirely to Laterpress. Similarly, if at the time of the reader payment, the referring user does not have Author Community features enabled and a Stripe account connected, the referral fee is only 10% and goes entirely to Laterpress. Note that if a subscription is attributable to Author Community Features, the referral fee applies to the initial subscription payment and renewals. For a full breakdown of payments, you can download the \"Payments\" report from the \"Reports\" tab of your author dashboard. What if I don't want to use Author Community features? Author Community features are completely optional, and always will be. If you just want to use Laterpress to sell your books directly to readers, toggle Author Community features off and that's it. We won't charge you anything, and no referral fees will apply.",

              "content": "News & Updates • Jul 22, 2022 Announcing user governance: Toward a community-led future for books Learn more about Laterpress's plans for user governance. Scott Kelly Update: Our draft user constitution is available for public view here and is under review by our User Working Group. --- At Laterpress, our mission is to create the kind of platform that we’re excited to publish and read on. We wanted a platform that made it easy to publish directly to our readers, so that’s what we built. We wanted authors to control how they price and paywall their fiction, so we created flexible payment options. Direct epub sales, instant audiobooks, user commenting – these features are all on our roadmap because we love storytelling and we want to build the best platform for it. But creating the platform we want to publish and read on goes beyond building the right product. It’s about building the right way. How to build a creator platform the wrong way The best way to understand what it means to build the right way is to consider what building the wrong way looks like. The story typically goes something like this: A company launches a great new platform for creators, and at first, the company does everything in its power to support those creators. The company offers low transaction fees, discovery based on merit, responsive customer service – anything to get more creators to join. But then the platform gets bigger, even more creators join, and suddenly… things change. Those low transaction fees jump up and up. Merit-based discovery morphs into pay-to-play promotion. Customer service becomes non-existent. If this story sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the same one that has played out again and again for creators. The question is: why? Why does it seem like every creator platform is destined to go from supporting to commoditizing creators just as the company gets big? The structural problem with creator platforms Let’s rule out one possibility right away: it’s not because people who found startups are especially sneaky or conniving. If anything, it’s the opposite. A lot of the people who found creator platforms are hardworking and well-intentioned, and just want to build awesome tools for people. That truth makes the history of creator platform disappointments even more worrisome. It means the reasons for this pattern go deep – down to the very roots of how these platforms are created and operated. Consider a creator platform about which all of the following is true: The platform is extremely useful. Creators and audiences love it, and they get more and more value from it every year. The company is profitable. It generates $10 million a year in revenues, with a healthy 40% margin. The employees of the company are happy. Everyone is well-paid and work-life balance is great. The company has reached its natural size. Its user growth is still going strong but its revenues have plateaued at the rate of inflation. What would most people call a company like this? A wild success. What would the people funding this company call it? A huge failure. There’s even a word venture capitalists use for this kind of company: zombie. This example illustrates a central truth about creator platforms: once these platforms stop growing revenue, while the rest of us may see a sustainable company, outside investors see a portfolio-eating undead monster. And that’s where we get back to the structural issue with creator platforms. The people who control these platforms (especially once they are big and have raised a lot of money to get there) are usually outside investors. 1 Making vs taking value The reason who controls the platform matters is because it determines how the platform reacts when revenue stops growing. If users and employees control the platform when revenues plateau, they can react with a big shrug. In the example we gave above, the company is sustainable with healthy profits. It’s producing a valuable externality for the world that grows day by day. Its employees love their jobs. What’s not to like? But if the company is publicly traded or controlled by venture firms when revenues plateau, the company has an obligation to outside investors to keep revenues growing… somehow. Turns out there is a playbook for this. When you can’t grow revenue by making value, you do it by taking value. A classic example of taking value is when a company introduces an ads program to what was once an ad-free discovery platform. As it happens, a certain major online bookstore recently doubled down on just that . This may be good for the small subset of authors who are especially savvy at running ad campaigns, but it’s a massive net negative for the platform’s users overall. For authors, it means that to get your book discovered on the platform, it’s no longer enough to write great, compelling books; it’s about paying for clicks. For readers, it means you are constantly bombarded with the best advertised books, not the best quality ones. The only stakeholders who benefit from this change are investors. Their bottomline grows as the ads program squeezes every last ounce of profit from author pocketbooks. This is just one example of how platforms take value; there are dozens of other tactics. Platforms can raise their fees once they’ve locked you into their proprietary payment system. They can change their algorithms to prioritize addictive content. They can promise creators they’ll be a faceless publisher that supports each creator’s brand – and then forcibly aggregate the audiences of those creators into one audience under the platform’s own brand. Unfortunately, when the taking starts, it’s usually too late for creators to leave. The corollary of this truth is that creator platforms never start out by taking value. If the platform tried, creators wouldn’t touch it with a ten-foot pole. The pivot only happens when the platform gets bigger, innovation gets harder, and creators are locked in. Add all this up and it leads to a simple, inescapable truth: Companies that want to avoid disappointing their users need to put users in control from the very beginning… while they still can. Just like Ulysses knew there was no way to resist the siren’s song, at Laterpress we know there’s no way to avoid the structural problems of creator platforms. That’s why, like Ulysses, we’re going to bind ourselves to the mast. 2 Binding Laterpress to the mast Binding Laterpress to the proverbial mast, alas, isn’t as simple as tying some rope. It requires a comprehensive strategy that takes into account the technical, financial, and cultural aspects of user control. Thankfully, we didn’t have to develop a strategy for all of this on our own. There’s a growing movement across the technology industry that’s calling into question the one-size-fits-all tactics of venture-funded startups: Maybe some startups should stay small 3 instead of blitzscaling? Maybe they should raise less money or no money at all? Maybe they should give users a vote instead of ruling by fiat? One of the leading thinkers from this movement, Li Jin, even developed a framework for understanding how platforms like Laterpress can go about putting creators in control. The framework certainly isn’t the only way we’re thinking about user control but it introduces the primary tactics we’re considering — and it’s to that framework we now turn. 4 1. “Ownership and portability” When authors publish on platforms like Amazon Kindle, Wattpad, and Patreon, those platforms own the relationship with the reader. The e-reader, app, or website readers use to read each author’s book is branded to those companies, and those companies have near total control over the experience, including how (or even if) readers are charged, and what authors earn. By owning the reader relationship, these platforms make portability nearly impossible: an author leaving their platform risks losing an audience they spent years building. We’ve engineered Laterpress to do the reverse: authors own the reader relationship and can leave whenever they want. We do this by letting authors publish books directly to their own website and collect payments using their own Stripe account. When readers sign up to read on an author’s website, it’s the author’s mailing list readers are prompted to join, not ours. Giving authors ownership also makes it easy for authors to stop using Laterpress without risking their audience. Authors can literally take their books, mailing list, and payments with them whenever they want. 5 By making it easy for authors to “vote with their feet” and leave with minimal friction, it keeps us honest as a platform. Put more bluntly: even if we wanted to listen to the siren song of “taking value” from our users, we’d have to think twice before doing so. 2. “Creator-friendly business model” The best way for a platform to ensure its business model is creator-friendly is to create alignment between the business of the platform and the creator. At Laterpress, the primary way we make money is via transaction fees on payments from readers to authors. That means we make money when authors make money Compare that to creator platforms where incentives are misaligned: for example, TikTok primarily makes money on ads. That means it has little incentive to make sure people creating videos get paid for that work; in fact, it's just the opposite. The less TikTok can pay video creators, the more margin it makes on its ads. Aligning the incentives of authors and Laterpress is a necessary first step toward a creator-friendly business model, but it's not sufficient. Even when business models align, there is a fundamental question of fairness. If a reader pays $10 to read a book, how much should the author get? How much should Laterpress? We think what's fair is keeping our fees low, but enough to provide the funds we need to operate and improve the platform (Currently, 0% on direct sales and 15% on referral sales). Of course, that sounds great in theory, but what's to keep Laterpress from going the way of most creator platforms and raising fees once we get big? The answer is to avoid getting big in the first place. Raising lots of venture capital sets the expectation that we'll be a huge company that delivers investors outsized returns. But not every problem requires a $10 billion company and 1,000 employees to solve it. That's why we don't strive to be big at Laterpress; we strive to be the right size. That means Laterpress is committed to two things for the foreseeable future: 1. Keep the team small: We're planning to keep our team size at twenty employees or less for as long as possible. Companies like Instagram, Whatsapp, and Notion all served tens of millions of people with small teams -- and those companies were started years ago when building software was much, much harder than it is today. 2. Founder funded: As the founder of Laterpress, I was fortunate enough to successfully build and sell a software company once before. That means Laterpress already has the funds it needs to operate for years and -- we strongly believe -- reach sustainability without taking a dime from outside investors. Is that all to say Laterpress will never consider hiring a 21st employee or raising funds? No. We can't predict the future. But our goal now and into the future is to stay the right size for the problem we're solving -- and we think the guidelines above will keep us that way. 3. “Creator interdependence and solidarity” There are two ways to design a creator platform: \"zero sum\" or \"positive sum\". With a zero-sum design, a platform pits creator against creator to extract as much business value as possible. An example of this I've already mentioned is when a platform layers advertising into its discovery functionality. Ads networks like Kindle’s -- where authors bid against authors to promote their books -- transfer as much money from authors to Amazon as possible. Bidding naturally drives up the price of discovery until authors are barely breaking even or, worse, paying for their passion. At Laterpress, we believe in positive sum design. Our goal is that as more authors join our platform, the value of the platform increases for authors as a whole, not just for us. That's why we're committed to keeping Laterpress ads free forever. That's right: No ads. Ever. Building a truly positive sum platform is about more than what we don't do. It means intentionally designing Laterpress to create positive-sum interactions that build solidarity and interdependence among authors. In the next few weeks, we'll be debuting functionality that does just that: our Laterpress Community. With Laterpress Community features, anytime the reader of one author discovers another author via the first author's \"Recommended\" section, the first author makes money on any subsequent purchase. Compare this to Amazon Kindle where the \"Also Bought\" sections of popular authors are driving tons of discovery -- and referring authors are receiving no compensation whatsoever. 6 This is the heart of positive sum design: creating loops of user interactions that benefit everyone involved. 4. “Neutral creator mechanisms” The most important mechanisms that govern creator platforms sit at opposite ends of the content spectrum. Moderation mechanisms govern what content is allowed on a platform, and recommendation mechanisms govern what content is promoted on a platform. Traditionally, control over these mechanisms has been highly centralized and extremely opaque. At Laterpress, we’re working toward a future where the platform’s moderation and recommendation mechanisms are truly open and neutral. The first pillar of our commitment to neutral mechanisms is our strong policy in favor of letting authors write what they want to write. Laterpress is fundamentally a platform designed to empower authors to publish directly to their own audiences, and we won’t be in the business of unilaterally censoring those direct relationships. 7 However, when an author opts into our Laterpress Community features, the platform does more than simply facilitate a direct connection between the author and their existing readers. Laterpress – and the other authors participating in the Community – actually help promote an author’s stories to new readers. This means the stories that readers discover through the Laterpress Community reflect not just on the author who wrote them but also indirectly on all other participating authors. For this reason, we believe it is critical that Community content policies are designed and controlled by our community itself – authors, readers, and employees together. This may seem like a radical departure from how many platforms approach these important mechanisms – but we think it’s a more equitable approach than concentrating all the power to end someone’s career (via a platform ban) or play kingmaker (via playing favorites with recommendations) into the hands of a few. What’s next for user governance at Laterpress This brings us to our last and most important announcement: Laterpress will be officially user-governed by the beginning of next year. What exactly do we mean by “user governed”? Over the coming months, we’ll be working alongside our User Working Group to draft a platform constitution that embeds five of the core user rights we’ve mentioned: We won’t raise fees on sales. Community features will always be optional. No ads. Ever. Minimal moderation of direct publishing. User control of the moderation and recommendation mechanisms of community publishing. We believe the five user rights outlined above are a great starting point but look forward to engaging with our community to give detail to those rights and to consider the inclusion of others. Once the platform’s constitution is drafted and in place, the next step is to hold our first user vote to determine the delegates to guide Laterpress in 2023 and beyond. Today’s announcement is a small but important first step toward a better future for storytelling. There is a lot of work ahead of us in the coming months and years but we look forward to doing it as a community of people who love stories. Want to chat with our team or get involved in building that better future? Reach out to us on Discord. ‍ Footnotes By the way, there is nothing wrong with outside investors! Investment is the fuel of innovation and many of the biggest leaps in science and software would’ve been impossible without it. The point is simply that investors have their own obligations (for example, to their investors) and those external obligations are very important to consider before a company takes on lots of outside capital. If you don’t understand this reference, you should read this amazing book ;-) Even the galactic emperor of venture himself, Sam Altman, has written about the advantages of companies that are designed to stay small. Li Jin’s primary focus is on the intersection of user governance and web3 but the principles of user governance are generally applicable. To be crystal clear: Laterpress is not a web3 company nor are we planning to use crypto for user governance. When we were first founded, we briefly explored the idea but the more we learned about the web3 space, the more our reservations grew. It’s a promising technology – but it still feels many, many years away from being generally useful for mainstream purposes. Technically, the way you migrate your subscriptions from one Stripe account to another requires first moving your customer and payment data between accounts, and then recreating your subscriptions . These Community features are completely optional. Authors who just want to use Laterpress to sell direct can always do so. While we will always have a bias in favor of letting authors publish directly to their own audience, we prohibit illegal, threatening, or purely pornographic content. In large part, we must have these minimal safeguards in order to keep providing our services to authors. For example, most payment processors will refuse to process payments for sites that host pornographic content.",

              "content": "Free and liberated ebooks, carefully produced for the true book lover. Standard Ebooks is a volunteer-driven project that produces new editions of public domain ebooks that are lovingly formatted, open source, free of U.S. copyright restrictions, and free of cost. Ebook projects like Project Gutenberg transcribe ebooks and make them available for the widest number of reading devices. Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed and professional-grade style manual, fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to create a new edition that takes advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser technology. Standard Ebooks aren’t just a beautiful addition to your digital library—they’re a high quality standard to build your own ebooks on. Browse our library of free ebooks What makes Standard Ebooks different? Modern & consistent typography Other free ebooks don’t put much effort into professional-quality typography: they use \"straight\" quotes instead of “curly” quotes, they ignore details like em- and en-dashes, and they look more like early-90’s web pages instead of actual books. Standard Ebooks applies a rigorous and modern style manual when developing each and every ebook to ensure they meet a professional-grade and consistent typographical standard. Our ebooks look good . Full proofing with careful corrections Transcriptions from other sources are often filled with typos or suffer from issues like inconsistent spelling, missing accent marks, or missing punctuation. Submitting corrections to such sources can be difficult or impossible, so errors are rarely fixed. At Standard Ebooks, we do a careful and complete readthrough of each ebook before releasing it, checking it against a scan of the original pages to fix as many typos as possible. Even if we do miss something, our ebooks are stored in the hugely popular Git source control system, allowing anyone to easily submit a correction. Rich & detailed metadata Our ebooks include complete, well-researched, and consistent metadata, including original, detailed book blurbs and links to encyclopedia sources. Perfect for machine processing or for extra-curious, technically-minded readers. State-of-the-art technology Each Standard Ebook takes full advantage of the latest ereader technology, including: Hyphenation support, Popup footnotes, High-resolution and scalable vector graphics, Ereader-compatible tables of contents, and more. One of our goals is to ensure our ebooks stay up-to-date with the best reading experience technology can provide. Just because it’s a classic doesn’t mean it has to use old technology. Quality covers Everyone knows a book is judged by its cover, but most free ebooks leave it to your ereader software to generate a drab default cover. Standard Ebooks draws from a vast collection of public domain fine art to create attractive, unique, appropriate, and consistent covers for each of our ebooks. Clean code & semantic markup Our strict coding standards allow technologists and ebook producers to use Standard Ebooks files as reliable, easy to read, and robust bases for their own work—not to mention as models of what well-crafted ebook files look like. Common code patterns are repeated through different ebooks, so the code never surprises you. Each ebook is also enhanced with careful standards-based semantic markup that opens the gateway for exciting new kinds of machine processing. Free, open-source, & public domain We use the popular Git source control system to track each and every change made to our ebooks. Anyone can easily see a history of changes, or contribute their own changes with the click of a mouse. And while all of the ebooks we feature and the cover art we draw from are already believed to be in the public domain in the U.S., Standard Ebooks releases all of the work we put in to each ebook into the public domain too. That makes each and every one of our ebook files not just free, but libre too—because the world deserves more unrestricted culture.",

                  "content": "The Standard Ebooks Manual of Style The Standard Ebooks Manual of Style describes a complete approach to editing and producing ebooks, from internal code style to semantic enhancement and typography rules. If a rule is not covered in this manual, the directive is to follow the rules in the latest edition of the Chicago Manual of Style . These rules align closely with the style rules used in modern publishing. However, books from the turn of the 20th century and older may appear to follow different rules. Producers are expected to adjust those older conventions to match this manual. Having said that, literature is a complex and multifaceted art, and in the process of converting older books some may call for a bending of a rule, or for an outright exception. Producers should not feel bound to slavishly follow these directives if a book seems to cry out for an exception. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” If unsure, producers are welcomed to contact the Standard Ebooks Editor in Chief for final-word guidance. To contribute to this manual, including reporting issues or suggestions, please visit the GitHub repository or contact the mailing list . Versioning The manual follows a variant of semantic versioning . The latest version of the manual can always be accessed at https://standardebooks.org/manual/latest . Typo fixes and minor corrections that do not make material changes to the manual do not increment a version number. An update that contains more than just corrections, but does not change the numbering of existing sections (but may add new sections in a non-breaking manner), increments the patch number. An update that changes the numbering of existing sections increments the minor number. An update that changes top-level sections increments the major number.

              "content": "All HP fanfic on AO3 ranked by kudos #3 Manacled by Senlinyu Ok. So. This is a heavy one. Not just for content, but for literally everything. First off I’ll just get into a basic summary of the plot. So in this au Voldemort won the war with Harry Potter and kills him. The remainder of the order are either killed, or if they’re women, they are turned into slaves purposed to help repopulate the wizarding world. Hermione is sent to Draco malfoy to be raped until she is pregnant because she has some memories and that are locked in her mind that a magical pregnancy might unlock. Word count is 370,515. Main ship is dramione. Trigger warnings: rape, assault, gore, major character death, PTSD, panic attacks, assault, torture. Oof so after reading that I’m sure you’re wondering, but how can they make Draco and Hermione end up together if he repeatedly assaults her? Well dear readers, that is what I like to call a fucked up relationship. I would’ve enjoyed this fic a whole lot more if I knew it wasn’t going to end with dramione as endgame. I understand why the author wanted that to happen, she put the readers and the characters through so much I suppose she felt like they deserve a happy ending. However, considering the circumstances of the fic, I do not think it should’ve happened that way. One thing I really really enjoyed about this fic was the writing structure. The first 25 chapters follow Hermione through her surrogacy enslavement with Malfoy after the war is over. After that are 75 chapters of flashbacks to Hermione during the war written in chronological order. After learning all this crucial information we are brought back to present day and the post-war life with Hermione as a Surrogate slave, but knowledgeable about the past. Holy shit it was so cool. While I was reading the flashbacks I kept remembering the situation present Hermione was in and getting to excited for what it all meant when it tied back together. Really well done. Obviously what I didn’t like was the relationship. I’ll be honest, I do not enjoy hetero ship fics so I’m probably very biased in writing this so take it all with a grain of salt. There is a bit of smut both consensual and non consensual but nothing too graphic. It’s pretty light for a rape fic. The relationship was very deep and confusing with the war and trauma. Because of this, I feel like it would’ve been a better ending if dramione didn’t work out and they parted ways rather than staying together. It’s a bit stokholmy and I don’t think it’s a healthy relationship. The characterization makes a lot of sense. For the most part. I do feel like Draco is out of character in places, mostly when he does things in aid of other people not himself, I feel like his loyalties and allegiance is very confusing and not explained enough why it is the way it is. Hermione is very different from the books but it is completely justified by the context of the fic. The author kept a consistent character base and developed her well from there. I’m a bit annoyed at the end because there was a moment where i felt like the author didn’t really know how to save all her characters because of the intricate rules of her universe, so she just wrote the answer into existence. It felt really cheap to me. The answer to all their problems literally appeared in one chapter and oh my god they never thought of it before because it was a secret that no one knew about. I didn’t like it that much. So this fic succeeded in confusing me. I think the author is very talented and has a beautiful sturucture to her story. However I morally disagree with the relationship how it is presented in the fic. If the relationship had panned out differently maybe I would’ve liked it more, but it didn’t. I would say read it if you’re super into dramione because it’s a staple in the dramione subculture. (Literally people print it out in hardback copies). If you’re triggered by rape obviously dont read it. It’s a long process but a very cool au, so read it for the discussion topic, but otherwise maybe skip this one. #manacled #dramione #senlinyu #hp fanfic #ao3 fanfic #ao3 link #au #postwar au #Harry Potter #dark fic #the handmaid's tale",

When Abby is captured and held for ransom by the notorious pirate Jack Rackham, Colleen and her father set out to rescue her, but when Charles Edwards is wounded, Colleen continues on the quest alone. If she can succeed in freeing the woman she loves, will it be possible for the two of them to create a life together? 16 February 2008 Announcement from KG MacGregor – I’m excited to announce the return of Anna & Lily in Without Warning, the first book in The Shaken Series. If you’ve been following my blog, you already know that Bella Books is bringing back the stories of Shaken, Stirred & Strained, all under individual covers with new and expanded scenes. Please visit the Book Page at my website to read the synopsis, the Xenaverse inspiration for these stories and Chapter 1. Book Description On a day that begins like any other, a violent earthquake strikes Los Angeles, plunging the region into chaos. Two strangers, trapped in a collapsed shopping mall, find each other amid the rubble and join forces to escape. Hampered by injury and darkness, they dig their way through one crumbled store after another, emerging long after most have given up hope for survivors. The ordeal leaves both women shaken, but their shared triumph sets them on a life-changing course, igniting a connection like neither has ever known. Anna Kaklis, whose perfectly planned life never included falling in love with another woman, is thrown for a loop, but she doesn’t doubt her heart. Lily Stewart, abandoned too many times by people she trusted, won’t let herself believe that Anna’s love will endure. Without Warning is the story of their courageous journey through adversity and their promise of steadfast love. 23 December 2007 Redback by Lindy Cameron Tribal warlords or multinational warmongers; insurgents or terrorists; politicians or rebels; the only real differences are scale, ideology, and how close they get to the action. After rescuing hostages from a Pacific Island, the Redbacks – a team of Australian retrieval agents led by Commander Bryn Gideon – stumble across the explosive plans of new terrorist group Atarsa Kára. US journalist Scott Dreher’s story on computer game training for real war reveals disturbing links between his government and known terrorists; Ashraf Majid leads his first mission for Atarsa Kára; and an assassin dispatches people on his hit list. Gideon and Scott uncover the connections between these incidents and a mysterious international group with no common political or religious affiliations. And when they finally join forces it’s a race against time to unravel a crazy conspiracy to ...Well, it’s enough to say that these new bad guys have no problem playing both sides of the terror divide against each other. I can’t rave enough about this book. Redback is comprehensively imagined, packed with incident and detail, and is more absorbing and more vividly written than most of its ilk. Redback is the new espionage thriller by the author of Golden Relic and the Kit O’Malley mysteries (Bywater Books USA). Lindy Cameron is contributing editor of the true crime anthology Meaner Than Fiction; and co-author, with Fin J Ross, of the forthcoming Killer in the Family (Five Mile Press).

But just like the storm clouds that suddenly form to rumble across a normally tranquil sky, life can just as easily be disrupted by unanticipated perils. Jesse Branson and Jennifer Kensington, thinking they have already experienced the worst life can offer, find them- selves facing new and unexpected threats to their happiness. Jennifer must face her father and the unwanted future he has planned for her, while Jesse faces an even greater threat that could not only take her from the woman she loves but could take her life. While Jesse and Jennifer fight to save each other and defend their love, the town of Sweetwater faces its own threats from Eastern developers that see the town as nothing more than a means to a profitable end. Will Jesse and Jennifer again prove that their love is stronger than those who have vowed to destroy it? Will they show they have what it takes to survive and build a life together on the frontier? And what of the town they now call home? Will Sweetwater remain the amiable town they enjoy or will it be ruined by outsiders in search of quick riches?

Lindy is an Australian author and I think people will enjoy reading her stories. Blood Guilt (Kit O'Malley Mystery Series) by Lindy Cameron Celia Robinson is paying PI Kit O'Malley big money to find out what Celia's philandering husband Geoffrey is up to with a blonde, a redhead, and entrepreneur Ian Dalkeith and his shady business cohorts. Enduring a heat wave and fighting the inanimate objects that are out to get her are the hardest parts of Kit's assignment-until a body is found floating in the Robinsons' ornamental fish pond. After the discovery of another body and a near miss with a homicidal driver, Kit realizes she's getting close to something-even if the truth seems to be that everyone has a secret. Click here to see more Kit O'Malley Mystery Novels by Lindy Where Shadows Linger - Sequel to In the Blood of the Greeks! Book #2 in the Eva and Zoe Series By MaryD Boy, this has been a difficult and long drawn out birth but Where Shadows Linger will be available in a few weeks - it's gone to the printers! I'm very excited and proud of this novel. It picks up a year after Eva and Zoe emigrate to Australia. It wasn't just the refugees that had a tough time in this novel; the author got a good workout as well through various Herculean trials and tribulations - this truly has been a blood, sweat and tears job but it's been worth it. I hope you all enjoy it as well. As I mentioned yesterday if you are going to the Burbank con, you can pick up a copy at the Bard's Banquet. And if you don't have the first novel \"In the Blood of the Greeks\", that will be there as well. Cover art is by Calli and artwork of Eva and Zoe was drawn by Lucia Nobrega. The mini synopsis: Having survived Nazi-occupied Greece and the liberation, Eva Muller and Zoe Lambros are still very much in love, wanting nothing more than to fulfill their dreams and hopes for the future. Emigrating to Sydney, Australia, the two women find themselves making new friends and forging a new life together. However, it is not long before their happiness is marred by prejudice, and the machinations of old enemies that plunge them into mortal danger. Will their unique connection be destroyed? Will they lose their new-found friends? Or will Eva and Zoe's love prove strong enough to overcome the shadows of the past that continue to linger in their lives?",

      "content": "2 Feb 2018 all right. so. this is a Harry Potter AU, in rambly and abbreviated form. this is a version of events where, on the morning of November 1st, 1981, the police are called to a house in Surrey. when they arrive, a large man with a red face and a moustache is waiting for them, brandishing a baby. to be more accurate: he is brandishing a basket. the basket contains a baby. he tells the police that his wife found the basket on their doorstep that morning. “Gave her the shock of her life,” he says, with a chuckle that does not seem the least bit sincere. the police officers have a lot of questions about this, but the man does not have any useful answers. his wife, he tells them, is not in any shape to be interviewed. “she’s been poorly,” he says, “and we’ve got a baby of our own to worry about, keeping us up at all hours.” the baby in the basket seems to be about a year old. he is cheerful, seems healthy aside from a cut on his forehead, with a crooked sticking plaster on it. he has startlingly green eyes. there is no identifying information in the basket, except for a torn scrap of paper with ‘his name is Harry’ on it in a delicate hand. there is nothing else to be done, it seems. the officers take baby Harry, and leave. one of them comes back a few days later for a follow-up interview with the woman who found the baby. she seems a little fragile, and her own baby, in the next room, keeps up a constant shrieking tantrum the whole time the officer is there. “I’m sorry,” the woman says, with a brittle smile. “this has all been a bit much. I recently lost my sister, you see.” so: that’s all for the Dursleys. baby Harry, on the bright side, is a sweet-tempered infant in good health, with no knows legal claimants to custody. he is adopted very quickly, by a family who has had a nursery standing empty for some time, and for whom he is the fulfillment of a long-awaited dream. so, rather than a cupboard under the stairs, Harry has a cozy bedroom with a window seat, a heap of stuffed animals, a rocking chair where his mother sings him lullabies that are really her favorite poems set to made-up tunes. he has a father who already owned a whole shelf of cookbooks the day they brought him home, and promptly starts filling a second shelf with South Asian cookbooks because he has read that children of color adopted by white parents should be able to maintain links to their culture of origin. he is not, from this point, Harry Potter. He is Harry Jones or McIntyre or Lee; more importantly, he is happy and loved. when Harry is two or three, something terrible happens that he knows nothing about. it does not make the Muggle papers, but it does, to Dumbledore’s dismay, make the Daily Prophet. there is a great deal of upset, and a number of people want to know why no one noticed, before now, that the Boy Who Lived has gone missing. the question of why no one noticed the murder of his aunt and uncle is quite secondary. Dumbledore has no good answers, and no luck at all in finding any. the problem of public attention, at least, solves itself when Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban, and captures the Daily Prophet’s front page for a good long while. it would be nice to think that whichever Death Eater tracked down and murdered Vernon and Petunia did not bother to murder Dudley. i am not sure I can offer you that comfort, sadly. they left without what they came for, at least: even if they had been able to find the police officers (they weren’t, as Vernon had long since forgotten their names), or the social worker who handled Harry’s case (who had changed jobs six months ago), they would never have been able to navigate Muggle bureaucracy well enough to find Harry himself. some people are more determined, though, and have better motivations. when Harry is six, a dog follows him home from school. in fact, the dog had also followed him to school that morning, waited patiently by the gate to the playground until recess, allowed innumerable children to pet him and tug his ears, and consented to play fetch only when it was Harry throwing the ball. his parents are surprised but not dismayed when their son comes home with an extremely large and exceptionally well-behaved black dog, and begs to keep him. “he looks just like that stuffed toy you loved when you were a baby,” his mother says. “remember?” the dog is christened Padfoot, after the toy, which name had been his parent’s best guess at what baby Harry had been calling it. luckily, they were good guessers. Padfoot is a very good dog. he does not chew things that ought not be chewed, he is wonderfully protective of Harry, he sheds much less than you would expect. he does, however, have a strange knack for removing every dog collar Harry’s parents buy for him within twenty-four hours. eventually, Harry goes out to the shed, locates a length of curb chain as thick as his thumb and a small carabiner, and attaches Padfoot’s tags and license to it. It ought to slip off right away, as it is far too loose to be called a collar, but to everyone but Harry’s surprise Padfoot tolerates it with perfect equanimity. it’s not like he ever actually needs a leash, anyway: it was already clear that taking Padfoot for a walk meant that both parties agreed to the polite fiction that the leash meant anything at all. he is an extremely smart dog. it’s a little uncanny. Harry’s parents never know that their dog’s original plan had been to kidnap their son, but that he had changed his mind after seeing their cheerful, bright house, the shelves of cookbooks and the wall of strangely frozen family photos, the rocking chair where Harry’s mother sings ‘come away, o human child’ to him at bedtime. Padfoot has lived with much worse. for Harry’s sake, he would again, but he’s glad he doesn’t have to. when Harry is eight, a number of extraordinary things happen: first of all, Harry and his dad decide to repaint Harry’s room. (this is not one of the extraordinary things.) that night, Harry sleeps on the downstairs sofa, as his room still smells of wet paint a bit too much. (neither is this.) he has a harder time falling asleep than usual: the sofa is a little too soft, and he is used to Padfoot sleeping on top of his feet, but there isn’t enough room so Padfoot is sleeping on the floor beside him instead. this is why Harry is still just barely awake when the extraordinary thing happens. (here it is:) Harry hears a strange sound, a sort of fluttering, scratching noise, and cracks open one eye. the living room is not quite dark, so he sees Padfoot get up and go silently over to the window. Padfoot noses the curtain aside. there is an owl outside the window, hooting urgently. Harry is now wide awake, but keeping perfectly still in case this turns out to be a dream after all. he doesn’t want to wake up in the middle of whatever this is. he watches as his dog opens the window. he wonders how he manages it with paws. the owl flies inside, swooping over the sofa towards the kitchen. Padfoot follows it. very carefully, as quietly as he can, Harry levers himself up enough to peer over the back of the sofa. he can see into the kitchen, where the owl has just landed on the table. Padfoot and the owl regard each other silently for a moment. then Padfoot lets out a doggy huff– a sort of ‘well, all right’ sound– and turns into a human being. this is too astonishing for Harry to even gasp at. the owl hoots softly at Padfoot, who is now a human person. “all right, all right,” grumbles Padfoot, formerly Harry’s dog, now a man with tangled black hair and ragged clothes. the man, who was until very recently a dog, takes a folded piece of paper from the owl. the owl hoots again, impatiently. “give me a moment, all right?” says the man who is also Harry’s dog, Padfoot. he opens the fridge and takes out the other half of the sandwich Harry’s dad had for lunch. he taps it with a wooden stick and quite suddenly there are two identical sandwiches, one of which the man-who-is-Padfoot puts back. the second one he eats. just sits down at Harry’s kitchen table like he wasn’t a dog a minute ago, pulls up a chair, and eats the sandwich, while unfolding and reading the piece of paper that the owl gave him. he gives some bits of sandwich to the owl, too. after he’s eaten, he takes a biro out of the jam jar in the middle of the table and writes something on the back of the paper, folds it back up, and gives it to the owl. the owl takes the paper in its talons, and swoops back out of the kitchen, over the sofa, and through the window. Harry watches it go, still astonished. then he turns back to the kitchen, where Padfoot, who is still a human and not at all a dog, is staring at him. Harry stares back. “damn,” says the man. “I suppose you have some questions.” “are you magic?” asks Harry. “yes,” says the man. he is wearing Padfoot’s tags and license on a necklace. “are you a werewolf?” asks Harry. “what? no,” says the man. “why would I– that’s not how werewolves work.” “well, no,” says Harry, who has now had a second to think about it and feels a little foolish. “I suppose you’d have to be, like, a reverse werewolf, right? because you’re a dog all month and now you’re a man.” “I’m not a reverse werewolf either,” says the man. “I’m your godfather.” “My fairy godfather?” Harry asks, because his mother read him a lot of Brothers Grimm. “not– in that sense, no,” says the man. “Just your regular godfather.” “my regular godfather, who is magic,” says Harry. “yes,” says Padfoot, who has lived in Harry’s house for two years now, and read most of the books on its shelves in the middle of the night, including the ones with titles like The Adoptive Parent’s Toolkit and My Family, My Journey . he says, “your birth dad was my best friend.” “was he magic too?” asks Harry. “yes,” says Padfoot. “and so was your mum. and so are you.” “what?” says Harry, who had not been expecting this turn of events in the least. “you’re a wizard, Harry,” says Padfoot. “and so am I.” edited to add: links to part two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten . there’s a masterpost here you can check for the rest. everything is tagged “ the dogfather ,” including asks and out-of-order bits. there is now an AO3 version . more as they get written! 38,454 notes #harry potter #not fic #hp au #harry potter au #yer a wizard harry #fanfiction #original #the dogfather #dogfather story post Show more notes Loading...

          "content": "nonasuch all right. so. this is a Harry Potter AU, in rambly and abbreviated form. this is a version of events where, on the morning of November 1st, 1981, the police are called to a house in Surrey. when they arrive, a large man with a red face and a moustache is waiting for them, brandishing a baby. to be more accurate: he is brandishing a basket. the basket contains a baby. he tells the police that his wife found the basket on their doorstep that morning. “Gave her the shock of her life,” he says, with a chuckle that does not seem the least bit sincere. the police officers have a lot of questions about this, but the man does not have any useful answers. his wife, he tells them, is not in any shape to be interviewed. “she’s been poorly,” he says, “and we’ve got a baby of our own to worry about, keeping us up at all hours.” the baby in the basket seems to be about a year old. he is cheerful, seems healthy aside from a cut on his forehead, with a crooked sticking plaster on it. he has startlingly green eyes. there is no identifying information in the basket, except for a torn scrap of paper with ‘his name is Harry’ on it in a delicate hand. there is nothing else to be done, it seems. the officers take baby Harry, and leave. one of them comes back a few days later for a follow-up interview with the woman who found the baby. she seems a little fragile, and her own baby, in the next room, keeps up a constant shrieking tantrum the whole time the officer is there. “I’m sorry,” the woman says, with a brittle smile. “this has all been a bit much. I recently lost my sister, you see.” so: that’s all for the Dursleys. baby Harry, on the bright side, is a sweet-tempered infant in good health, with no knows legal claimants to custody. he is adopted very quickly, by a family who has had a nursery standing empty for some time, and for whom he is the fulfillment of a long-awaited dream. so, rather than a cupboard under the stairs, Harry has a cozy bedroom with a window seat, a heap of stuffed animals, a rocking chair where his mother sings him lullabies that are really her favorite poems set to made-up tunes. he has a father who already owned a whole shelf of cookbooks the day they brought him home, and promptly starts filling a second shelf with South Asian cookbooks because he has read that children of color adopted by white parents should be able to maintain links to their culture of origin. he is not, from this point, Harry Potter. He is Harry Jones or McIntyre or Lee; more importantly, he is happy and loved. when Harry is two or three, something terrible happens that he knows nothing about. it does not make the Muggle papers, but it does, to Dumbledore’s dismay, make the Daily Prophet. there is a great deal of upset, and a number of people want to know why no one noticed, before now, that the Boy Who Lived has gone missing. the question of why no one noticed the murder of his aunt and uncle is quite secondary. Dumbledore has no good answers, and no luck at all in finding any. the problem of public attention, at least, solves itself when Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban, and captures the Daily Prophet’s front page for a good long while. it would be nice to think that whichever Death Eater tracked down and murdered Vernon and Petunia did not bother to murder Dudley. i am not sure I can offer you that comfort, sadly. they left without what they came for, at least: even if they had been able to find the police officers (they weren’t, as Vernon had long since forgotten their names), or the social worker who handled Harry’s case (who had changed jobs six months ago), they would never have been able to navigate Muggle bureaucracy well enough to find Harry himself. some people are more determined, though, and have better motivations. when Harry is six, a dog follows him home from school. in fact, the dog had also followed him to school that morning, waited patiently by the gate to the playground until recess, allowed innumerable children to pet him and tug his ears, and consented to play fetch only when it was Harry throwing the ball. his parents are surprised but not dismayed when their son comes home with an extremely large and exceptionally well-behaved black dog, and begs to keep him. “he looks just like that stuffed toy you loved when you were a baby,” his mother says. “remember?” the dog is christened Padfoot, after the toy, which name had been his parent’s best guess at what baby Harry had been calling it. luckily, they were good guessers. Padfoot is a very good dog. he does not chew things that ought not be chewed, he is wonderfully protective of Harry, he sheds much less than you would expect. he does, however, have a strange knack for removing every dog collar Harry’s parents buy for him within twenty-four hours. eventually, Harry goes out to the shed, locates a length of curb chain as thick as his thumb and a small carabiner, and attaches Padfoot’s tags and license to it. It ought to slip off right away, as it is far too loose to be called a collar, but to everyone but Harry’s surprise Padfoot tolerates it with perfect equanimity. it’s not like he ever actually needs a leash, anyway: it was already clear that taking Padfoot for a walk meant that both parties agreed to the polite fiction that the leash meant anything at all. he is an extremely smart dog. it’s a little uncanny. Harry’s parents never know that their dog’s original plan had been to kidnap their son, but that he had changed his mind after seeing their cheerful, bright house, the shelves of cookbooks and the wall of strangely frozen family photos, the rocking chair where Harry’s mother sings ‘come away, o human child’ to him at bedtime. Padfoot has lived with much worse. for Harry’s sake, he would again, but he’s glad he doesn’t have to. when Harry is eight, a number of extraordinary things happen: first of all, Harry and his dad decide to repaint Harry’s room. (this is not one of the extraordinary things.) that night, Harry sleeps on the downstairs sofa, as his room still smells of wet paint a bit too much. (neither is this.) he has a harder time falling asleep than usual: the sofa is a little too soft, and he is used to Padfoot sleeping on top of his feet, but there isn’t enough room so Padfoot is sleeping on the floor beside him instead. this is why Harry is still just barely awake when the extraordinary thing happens. (here it is:) Harry hears a strange sound, a sort of fluttering, scratching noise, and cracks open one eye. the living room is not quite dark, so he sees Padfoot get up and go silently over to the window. Padfoot noses the curtain aside. there is an owl outside the window, hooting urgently. Harry is now wide awake, but keeping perfectly still in case this turns out to be a dream after all. he doesn’t want to wake up in the middle of whatever this is. he watches as his dog opens the window. he wonders how he manages it with paws. the owl flies inside, swooping over the sofa towards the kitchen. Padfoot follows it. very carefully, as quietly as he can, Harry levers himself up enough to peer over the back of the sofa. he can see into the kitchen, where the owl has just landed on the table. Padfoot and the owl regard each other silently for a moment. then Padfoot lets out a doggy huff– a sort of ‘well, all right’ sound– and turns into a human being. this is too astonishing for Harry to even gasp at. the owl hoots softly at Padfoot, who is now a human person. “all right, all right,” grumbles Padfoot, formerly Harry’s dog, now a man with tangled black hair and ragged clothes. the man, who was until very recently a dog, takes a folded piece of paper from the owl. the owl hoots again, impatiently. “give me a moment, all right?” says the man who is also Harry’s dog, Padfoot. he opens the fridge and takes out the other half of the sandwich Harry’s dad had for lunch. he taps it with a wooden stick and quite suddenly there are two identical sandwiches, one of which the man-who-is-Padfoot puts back. the second one he eats. just sits down at Harry’s kitchen table like he wasn’t a dog a minute ago, pulls up a chair, and eats the sandwich, while unfolding and reading the piece of paper that the owl gave him. he gives some bits of sandwich to the owl, too. after he’s eaten, he takes a biro out of the jam jar in the middle of the table and writes something on the back of the paper, folds it back up, and gives it to the owl. the owl takes the paper in its talons, and swoops back out of the kitchen, over the sofa, and through the window. Harry watches it go, still astonished. then he turns back to the kitchen, where Padfoot, who is still a human and not at all a dog, is staring at him. Harry stares back. “damn,” says the man. “I suppose you have some questions.” “are you magic?” asks Harry. “yes,” says the man. he is wearing Padfoot’s tags and license on a necklace. “are you a werewolf?” asks Harry. “what? no,” says the man. “why would I– that’s not how werewolves work.” “well, no,” says Harry, who has now had a second to think about it and feels a little foolish. “I suppose you’d have to be, like, a reverse werewolf, right? because you’re a dog all month and now you’re a man.” “I’m not a reverse werewolf either,” says the man. “I’m your godfather.” “My fairy godfather?” Harry asks, because his mother read him a lot of Brothers Grimm. “not– in that sense, no,” says the man. “Just your regular godfather.” “my regular godfather, who is magic,” says Harry. “yes,” says Padfoot, who has lived in Harry’s house for two years now, and read most of the books on its shelves in the middle of the night, including the ones with titles like The Adoptive Parent’s Toolkit and My Family, My Journey . he says, “your birth dad was my best friend.” “was he magic too?” asks Harry. “yes,” says Padfoot. “and so was your mum. and so are you.” “what?” says Harry, who had not been expecting this turn of events in the least. “you’re a wizard, Harry,” says Padfoot. “and so am I.” edited to add: links to part two and part three . more as they get written!",

Sirius spent two awful years in Azkaban, and five years free. since the day he found Harry, he has been saving up all the things he wants to tell his godson. so he starts at the beginning: “I met James and Lily on the train to Hogwarts, when we were eleven. that’s the school for witches and wizards; you’ll go there too, when you’re older.” for the rest of his life, Harry will remember how his first impression of the wizarding world was formed: his godfather’s hoarse voice, full of affection for the dead, the only sound in the silent house. the darkened kitchen, the wandlight Padfoot casts throwing his too-thin face into sharp relief. that light and that warmth, keeping the dark at bay. when he gets to the part about Harry’s aunt and uncle, he hesitates. he’s plowed through the telling of the awful night that James and Lily died, Wormtail’s betrayal, his own mad grief, and it’s only now occurring to him that much of it was not a story an eight-year-old boy ought to hear. no matter how much of a right he has to hear it. so he says: “you were supposed to go to live with your mother’s sister. I don’t know why, exactly, but you ended up here instead. no one in the wizarding world knew how to find you.” (this is only very slightly a lie: four years ago, he and Remus tracked down the police report filed by the officers who took Harry away from the Dursleys. then they destroyed it, so that no one else could follow the same trail to Harry.) he tells Harry, “in Azkaban, five years ago, a visitor let me have a newspaper. I saw that your aunt and uncle had died, but you were missing. so I escaped, and I found you.” Harry asks, “but what happened to them?” Sirius says “I don’t know. not for certain.” (this is rather more of a lie. he has some very good guesses.) this is clearly not enough of an answer for Harry, but he is eight years old and it has been a very eventful night. he’s yawning, his eyes drooping shut. “I’ll tell you the rest, but not tonight,” Sirius says. “can you sleep on the sofa?” Harry makes a face. “it’s too squashy,” he says. so his godfather transfigures the sofa into a decent approximation of Harry’s bed upstairs, and tucks Harry in. he turns back into Padfoot and flops down across Harry’s feet. just before he falls asleep, harry murmurs “you’re my godfather. and you’re a dog. you’re my dogfather.” this is the funniest joke in the history of eight-year-olds, and Harry falls asleep mid-giggle. in the morning, Harry wakes up to find the sofa has gone back to being a sofa and his dog has gone back to being a dog. his mum is putting on her earrings in the hall mirror, and whistling to herself. his dad is making breakfast noises in the kitchen. but: there is a large tawny feather on the end table. Harry recalls, vividly, watching the owl preen itself while Padfoot read his letter at the kitchen table. he looks at Padfoot. Padfoot holds his gaze for a long, deliberate moment, and then he winks. that whole day, Harry is full of restless energy. he and his dad finish painting the spots they missed the day before, and put his furniture back where it belongs. but his heart’s not in it. all day he is wondering: am I really magic? what does that mean? what kind of magic can I do? do I need to have a magic wand? how do i get a magic wand? will Padfoot let me borrow his? can I do magic without it? his parents notice his distraction, of course, but they let it pass. Harry will tell him what’s wrong when he’s ready to. he always has before. by bedtime, Harry is practically vibrating. Padfoot flops down across the end of the bed with a little more force than usual, and fixes Harry with a doggy glare until Harry settles. his mum reads him a chapter of The Sword in the Stone , and Harry lets her sing him a lullabye even though he’s started saying, lately, that he’s too old for lullabies. she sings, to the tune she made up when Harry was a baby, come away, o human child, to the waters and the wild , and Harry does his best to act sleepy as she goes through the verses. when the house is finally silent, Harry sits up in bed. “now?” he asks. Padfoot sighs and grumbles and jumps down from the bed and turns into a human being again. “try not to explode,” says Sirius, and Harry’s eyes get very big. “can that happen? to wizards?” he asks, and Sirius has his first really good belly laugh in about seven and a half years. once they have both calmed down a little, Sirius answers as many of Harry’s questions as he can. he tells Harry that, yes, most wizards need a wand to do most magic, but that children sometime will do wandless magic by accident. that there are wizarding banks and shops and bureacrats. that there is owl post and order-by-floo. that there are wizarding towns and magical neighborhoods hidden all over the world. that while werewolves are real, reverse werewolves are not. harry remembers to ask, then: “who sent you the owl last night?” so sirius explains that there is one other wizard in the world who knows where Harry is, and who knows that Sirius was wrongfully convicted, and that he is using the Fidelius charm to protect them. Sirius has not seen Moony in person for more than a year, and misses him like hell. the last time had been when Harry and his parents had gone to visit a family friend with very bad allergies, and been out of the house long enough that Sirius could Apparate away. the flat where Moony was staying was shabby and awful, of course. even though, years ago, Sirius had given Moony the key to his bank vault and all but ordered him to use it. the shabby, awful flat had not actually mattered very much to either of them. it had a table where they sat side-by-side for an hour or so, shoulders pressed together, and went over what Remus had found in the course of hunting for Wormtail. it also contained a bed, where they spent the rest of the day. and that was all, for year. writing letters helps, a little. a very little. (none of the above is included in Padfoot’s explanation. that is most definitely a conversation for the future, when Harry has known his dog is a wizard for more than twenty-four hours, and Sirius had worked out what to say without using horrible euphemisms or embarrassing them both to death.) once Harry has run out of questions, or at least paused to pick out the next set, Sirius says, “we should talk about your mum and dad. what are you going to tell them?” (he’s read all the parenting books in the house. they mostly recommend that parents should do the exact opposite of whatever his own parents would have done, so he thinks the Muggles might have the right idea on this particular front. and they’re all very big on honesty and communication.) “well,” says Harry, and falls silent, thinking. “should I tell them I’m magic?” “that’s up to you,” says Padfoot. “I think you’ll want to, sooner or later, and you’ll have to, before you go to Hogwarts.” “wait,” says Harry, “if no wizards know where I am, how can I go–” “don’t worry about it,” says Sirius. “Moony and I are working on that.” (this is not a lie because they are, in fact, working on it. they just haven’t actually found a solution yet.) “okay,” says Harry. “then I want to tell them soon. and they should meet you. but, um. you should get some not-magic clothes?” “what’s wrong with my clothes?” asks sirius, who is fully aware that they are basically rags, but he spends ninety percent of his time as a dog, nine percent alone, and one percent with Moony. so he only really wears clothes at all for that nine percent. (sometimes, as Padfoot, he condescends to wear a red bandanna.) “they’re a bit, um.” says harry. his trying-not-to-disapprove-and-failing look is so perfectly Lily’s that Sirius cannot bring himself to disagree. “all right, all right, I’ll smarten up a bit,” says Sirius. “think about how you want to break the news, eh?” Harry agrees, and now the day’s nervous energy is entirely used up. he is asleep before Sirius has even changed back to Padfoot. so Sirius nicks some of Harry’s dad’s clothes from the laundry and charms them to a) fit and b) not look obviously stolen. also he cuts his hair. it makes his ears feel cold but he does look less like a crazed escaped wizard murderer, so ten points to Harry on that one. the next night Harry says “oh that’s much better” in deeply relieved and deeply Evans-esque tones, the moment Padfoot turns into Sirius. Sirius is too happy to be insulted, much. 6,363 notes #harry potter #harry potter au #sirius black #the dogfather #not-fic #hp au #yer a wizard harry #original #dogfather story post Show more notes Loading...

              "content": "3 Feb 2018 (link to: part one , part two ) more rambly AU, which I am just gonna go ahead and call “the dogfather AU” from now on, and tag accordingly: the next week of Harry’s life is very strange. up to this point, the biggest secret he’s ever kept from his parents was that his mum had bought his dad a stand mixer for Christmas last year. and that was only keeping a secret from one parent. this is at least twice as hard as that. luckily for Harry, painting his room has given Harry’s dad what his mum calls “a case of the DIYs,” so both his parents are a little preoccupied: his dad with pulling up old carpet and repainting cabinets; his mum with finding places to put the furniture and dishes until he’s done. then Harry’s dad decides it is Time To Re-Roof The Shed. Harry’s dad has claimed it was Time To Re-Roof The Shed at least once a year for as long as Harry can remember. this is the first time it has seemed at all likely that it will actually happen. this is what leads to: Harry’s dad is on top of a ladder, tugging old pieces of tar paper off the shed roof. his mum is holding the ladder. Harry is holding a ball, which Padfoot is waiting patiently for him to throw. Harry sees the following happen, in what seems like slow motion: his dad pulls a little too hard at a stuck piece of tar paper. it comes loose abruptly. he loses his balance, and goes toppling backwards off the ladder with a shout. Harry’s heart, it seems, makes a valiant attempt at leaping out of his mouth– and then his dad, rather than falling to the ground with a bone-rattling thud, floats down as softly as a soap bubble. he sits up, bewildered but unharmed, and looks to Harry. Harry remembers it later, very vividly. the first thing his mum and dad did was look at him. then their gazes slide past him, going from startled to outright astonished. Harry turns to see that, behind him, Padfoot is human-shaped and brandishing his wand. “um,” says Harry. “hell,” says Padfoot. “language!” says Harry’s dad. “oh, honestly,” says Harry’s mum, and helps Harry’s dad to his feet. when they all go inside to have a very long and awkward conversation, they are brought up short when they remember that the the living room carpet has recently been torn up and there is not really anywhere to sit. there are only three chairs for the kitchen table. everyone looks at each other for a moment, a bit helplessly. Harry tries and fails to stifle a giggle. Padfoot sighs and points his wand at the pile of torn-up carpet bits and mutters something that turns it into a chair. he drags it behind him, into the kitchen, and Harry and his parents follow. “right,” says Padfoot, and plonks the chair down at the kitchen table. it is almost but not quite a match for the other three: the spindles are the wrong shape and the seat has a slightly different print. “Padfoot’s my godfather!” Harry says brightly, climbing into the next chair. “he’s magic! he says my first mum and dad were magic too!” Harry’s mum and dad exchange a look that Harry cannot interpret in the slightest, and sit down. “so are you… I don’t know, a werewolf?” Harry’s mum asks. “where are Muggles getting these ideas– no. sorry, let’s start over.” Padfoot tells them a heavily edited-down version of the story he told Harry, doing his best to elide over the ‘technically an escaped convict’ and ‘evil wizards want Harry dead’ bits. they are surprised by this, but not… quite as surprised as Sirius expected them to be. “when Harry was a baby, he had a mobile,” his mum says, slowly, considering. “over his crib. it used to spin on its own, all the time.” “remember– the courgettes,” Harry’s dad says, and his mum nods. Harry makes a face. “I hate courgettes!” he says. “we know,” says his mum. “when you were two, all of the courgettes in the house disappeared,” says his dad. “for a month, every time we tried to bring any home, they would vanish again. we gave up buying any for a year!” “this is why we always had snakes at the back of the garden at our old house!” says his mum. “harry, you made friends with them. I’d be hanging out the washing, and you’d toddle over with half a dozen garter snakes wrapped round your arms, wanting to introduce me.” “so you knew I was magic?” Harry says. his mum makes a face. “we didn’t know what to think. it seemed impossible.” “but we thought you were– special, somehow,” says his dad. Sirius feels as if he has lost control of this conversation, a bit. (it occurs to him that perhaps there was a reason, beyond Muggle silliness and superstition, that Harry’s parents have gone to such lengths to fill their son’s head with stories about Muggle myths and Muggle magic: with fairy godmothers and wise sorcerers and noble quests. they were trying, as best they could, to give their adopted son a sense of connection to the culture of his birth– without knowing what it was.) (Harry is an adult before he works this out for himself. he is grateful for it, and has been grateful for it all along.) “all right, let’s leave that aside for now. we’ve got off track,” says Harry’s dad. “you’ve been hanging around here for two years, pretending to be a dog. why not just tell us?” “the fewer people know, the safer Harry will be,” says Sirius. “I promised James and Lily I’d keep him safe. that’s all I care about.” there is a short, uncomfortable silence, broken by Harry when he tugs at Padfoot’s sleeve and hisses “tell them about the wizard school!” 5,726 notes #harry potter #harry potter au #not fic #the dogfather #dogfather story post Show more notes Loading...

          "content": "Posted on Apr 19, 24 all right. so. this is a Harry Potter AU, in rambly and abbreviated form. this is a version of events where, on the morning of November 1st, 1981, the police are called to a house in Surrey. when they arrive, a large man with a red face and a moustache is waiting for them, brandishing a baby. to be more accurate: he is brandishing a basket. the basket contains a baby. he tells the police that his wife found the basket on their doorstep that morning. “Gave her the shock of her life,” he says, with a chuckle that does not seem the least bit sincere. the police officers have a lot of questions about this, but the man does not have any useful answers. his wife, he tells them, is not in any shape to be interviewed. “she’s been poorly,” he says, “and we’ve got a baby of our own to worry about, keeping us up at all hours.” the baby in the basket seems to be about a year old. he is cheerful, seems healthy aside from a cut on his forehead, with a crooked sticking plaster on it. he has startlingly green eyes. there is no identifying information in the basket, except for a torn scrap of paper with ‘his name is Harry’ on it in a delicate hand. there it nothing else to be done, it seems. the officers take baby Harry, and leave. one of them comes back a few days later for a follow-up interview with the woman who found the baby. she seems a little fragile, and her own baby, in the next room, keeps up a constant shrieking tantrum the whole time the officer is there. “I’m sorry,” the woman says, with a brittle smile. “this has all been a bit much. I recently lost my sister, you see.” Keep reading 38454 read this post Show more notes Loading...",

They must feed, clothe, and house the Jester according to the Jesters wishes, may not fire the Jester, and may not retaliate against the Jester, as the Jester will have Jesters Privileges. One must spend at least three hours per day on the company of your Jester, and allow the Jester access to your quarterly reports. The Jesters will be chosen by voluntary lottery. Jesters will be regularly interviewed to make sure they have not become Lackeys. This law will prevent rich folk from being surrounded with vapid yes-men. A lot of problems with the world right now are happening becuse rich and powerful men don’t have anybody on hand to say “That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.” I feel like we could combine this with the federally mandated dunk tank and save democracy. 19,627 notes 15 Nov 2025 Kind of a devastating narrative crafted by the playlist shuffle at work today. 121 notes #vintage shop life 15 Nov 2025 inbabylontheywept : People are so much more sad, and desparate, and lonely than you think. I have had three incidents in the last four months were a technician I was working with was being either dangerously unfocused (we work with high voltage), or just flat out angry with their coworkers, and every time when I just pulled them aside to say hey, this isn’t you, you’re nice, and you’re competent, so something must be up - what can I do to help - they have responded by bursting into tears. One guy was struggling to get his wife moved into a care home, one guy just got served divorce papers, and the other hadn’t slept a wink the night before because his daughter had the pukes. I haven’t spent my whole life responding to people being rude, or stupid, or dangerous with knee jerk compassion. It’s a new habit. The first time I did that as the lead for my lab, it was because the guy genuinely was so good natured that I knew something had to be off. But the other two times were just me going, alright, lets see if it always goes this well, and so far, it has. I’m almost 30, and I just figured out that the #1 reason people are shitty are because they are going through shit. I don’t think you have, like, a moral obligation to respond to people being jerks with knee jerk compassion. But it has made my life so much easier the last four months that I would recommend trying. For your own sake. Please. (I’ll step off my soapbox now. Enjoy your Sunday.) 61,738 notes #tikkun olam 14 Nov 2025 mouseindahouseforalouse : j4v4r10 : sgt-cookie-2 : nonasuch : figtreeandvine : nonasuch : here is a concept: time travel cop, fish & wildlife division most of their job is dealing with the kinds of assholes who think black market tiger cubs are a great idea right up until someone gets mauled, except these are even bigger assholes with black market Smilodon cubs that they are even less equipped to care for this is the most straightforward and therefore relatively headache-free part of their job, because it’s the same “put that thing back where it came from or so help me” song and dance every time it’s also significantly less depressing than the trophy hunters who don’t even want an alive extinct animal. those are extra annoying because you have to undo the time travel that let them kill that poor Megatherium or thylacine or anklyosaur or whatever, and it’s always so much extra paperwork. and those people suck, definitely, and have fully earned a stint in Time Jail. no question. but they still do not create anywhere near as much work as the obsessive hobbyists with their exhaustively careful best practices and worryingly good track-covering. also, weirdly, it’s almost always birds with them? like. the guys who will flagrantly abuse Time Law to bird-nap breeding pairs just long enough to raise one clutch of eggs apiece, and return them seamlessly to their spots on the timeline. who are so determined to keep their pet (ha) projects going that no one even realizes what they’re doing until they have an entire stable breeding population of passenger pigeons up and running. who are now the reason that reps from six different zoos are about to start throwing hands right in front of you over who gets dibs. those guys cause the most paperwork. and half the time they’re snapped up by the same zoo or wildlife preserve that gets their colony of ivory-billed woodpeckers or Carolina parakeets or — once, very memorably — giant fucking South Island moa, and they never even spend a day in Time Jail. Ooh! There have been a few “surprise, not extinct!” events recently, again weirdly almost always birds, though occasionally fish. What if they really did go extinct, but someone from 2459 went back to 1900, built up a minimum breeding population in 2459, and then released them into the wild in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015? Releasing new groups every five years in our century would avoid a sudden suspicious population surge and no one would think to look for the culprit in their own century because Jerdon’s Babbler (real-world example, rediscovered in 2014) has always been there/then. You could build a novel around the relationship between the time cop and the rogue bird lover. The time cop caught the bird lover over the passenger pigeons. They went to time jail for 10 years outside the timeline, and then were hired to manage the passenger pigeons by an accredited zoo’s. The time cop suspects they’re still up to something, but other than the passenger pigeons, all they appear to be doing is raising research colonies of perfectly ordinary birds. Except all the species they’re working with were believed to be extinct at one point…. One thing real world zoos do now is…well…something like elven changelings if you think about it. They time the mating of a captive breeding pair to that of an isolated wild breeding pair in places where inbreeding is a serious risk. Then they swap a captive-born offspring for a wild-born–each breeding pair unknowingly raising a foster. Both zoos and the wild population get improved genetic diversity, without the risk inherent in “rewilding” a zoo-born adult. Doing that with birds and time travel would be even easier–grab an egg, take it to the future, raise and breed it, take an egg back to the original nest. The original parents raise their grandchild, not their child. The hardest part for me would be explaining why the time cop thought this was wrong! oh I love all of this. i think the time cop would eventually just be like “PLEASE get a license from an accredited zoo already so i can stop having to deal with you” but the accredited zoos aren’t on board with the “release into the wild 200 years ago” part of the scheme and also our rogue bird enthusiast has a white whale and that white whale is Haast’s eagle “The hardest part for me would be explaining why the time cop thought this was wrong!” Simple: What the bird lover’s doing isn’t objectively wrong, it’s that they’re doing it without a license and flouting every regulation on the book because they just think “Pretty birb” without actually considering the long-term enviromnental impact. Like, “Yes, it’s completely understandable why you’re doing this. But this biosphere hasn’t had to deal with voracious nut eaters in over 600 years! The insect population has become dependent on the rotting nonviable nuts as a foodsource that drop to the ground and you’ve gona and reintroduced a species that eats them off the trees! The lower level biodiversity is in tatters due to the now declining insect population and don’t even think about going back in time again to fix the mistake! Leave that to a professional and next time fill out the god fucking damn forms in order to do it properly! ” Can you imagine all of the legal ramifications of time migratory bird protections? Like, if in 2034 the California Condors go extinct just to be reintroduced the next day, that seems like barely a continuity error. But if you reintroduced Teratornis to modern day California, they would wreak so much havoc on the ecosystem! So where do you draw the line? How long does a species have to be extinct before they are classified as eon-invasive? @goodnoobseveryone @goodnoobseveryone This reminds me of my coworker who literally and sincerely thinks that when we rediscover species that we thought were extinct it is because they were reintroduced from somewhere else via wormholes. Hang on everyone shut up I need to hear more about @mouseindahouseforalouse ’s coworker 16,418 notes 14 Nov 2025 Please tell me you wrote the captions they are so delightful (cries in has no need for a vintage baby carriage but its so whimsy I love it.

My parents are selling their house and downsizing to a condo. I’m getting the house ready for an estate sale. There is a lot of Stuff, including a genuinely distressing number of Beanie Babies. Most of it is going to be pretty straightforward to price and sell. My dad is ebaying some of the more valuable stuff. That’s all fine. My dad is a podiatrist, and so was my grandfather, so we also have things like his doctor’s bag from the 1950s (cool), film negatives of medically interesting feet (gross, but in a cool way), and badly out-of-date podiatry textbooks (gross, but in a boring way). And. well. also there’s a human femur. It was my grandfather’s, presumably for educational purposes. I cannot legally sell it in the state of Maryland and I don’t think I’d want to even if I could. I am certainly not keeping it. Throwing it out seems a) disrespectful and b) likely to cause an accidental police investigation. Guys, I do not know What The Fuck To Do With This Thing. I’m not sure that I should be turning to the bone-stealing witch website for ideas but my other options are mostly subreddits full of people who are a little too excited about the idea of owning a real human femur. Help. For those of you who accompanied me and my grandpa’s medical specimen human femur on this journey, I thought you might like to know that the estate sale is next weekend (Nov 21-23) and you can find the listing here also I did give the femur to the goth teen. It will not be a part of the estate sale. 2,951 notes 13 Nov 2025 buffysummers : Top 10 BtVS characters (as voted by my followers): #3 — Rupert Giles (67.2%) ↳ “It’s terribly simple.

              "content": "Terms of Service Last Modified: 2024-09-06 Tumblr is a U.S. company and subject to U.S. laws and jurisdiction. The original version of these Terms of Service (and any other terms, policies, or guidelines that we provide to you) are written in English. To the extent any translated version of these Terms of Service (or any other terms, policies, or guidelines that we provide to you) conflicts with the English version, the English version controls. THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAIN LIMITATIONS OF TUMBLR'S LIABILITY IN SECTION 15. Hello! Welcome to Tumblr’s Terms of Service. Please read this carefully before using our site, services, or products. This is a contract between you and Tumblr. We've also included several annotations that aren't a part of the contract itself, but are intended to emphasize key sections and help you follow the text. We've tried to be fair and straightforward. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or suggestions! 1. Accepting the Terms of Service Please read these Terms of Service and our User Guidelines (collectively, the \" Agreement \") carefully before using tumblr.com (the \" Site \") and/or the other domains, websites, products, applications, mobile applications, services, and/or Content provided by Tumblr, Inc. (all of those collectively with the Site, the \" Services \") (Tumblr, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Automattic Inc., a Delaware corporation (\" Automattic \"), collectively with its agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors, \" Tumblr ,\" \" we ,\" or \" us \"). By using or accessing the Services, you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you don't agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you shouldn't, and aren't permitted to, use the Services. Tumblr’s personalized Services cannot be provided and the terms of this Agreement cannot be performed without Tumblr processing information about you and other users. Processing of the information you share with Tumblr is essential to the personalized Services which we provide and which you expect, including personalized Content (as described below) and ads, and is a necessary part of our performance of the agreement we have with you. We’re just letting you know, here, that Tumblr is now part of Automattic , a technology company that empowers people to build beautiful websites, tell their stories, and find and grow their audience and these Terms of Service , which apply to your use of Tumblr, have been updated to reflect this change. This section also includes an agreement where you're agreeing to agree to the terms of this Agreement. 2. Modifications to this Agreement Tumblr reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service or our User Guidelines by providing notice to you. We will provide notice to you by posting a revised version of the modified Terms of Service or User Guidelines on the Services, and, in some cases we may provide additional notice to you such as via email, or otherwise through the Services (such as through a notification on your Tumblr Dashboard or in our mobile applications). Modifications will not apply retroactively. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to this Agreement. We may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to (or reject) a revised version of this Agreement. In such cases, modifications will be effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of this Agreement. If you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use the Services. In cases where we do not ask for your explicit agreement to a modified version of this Agreement, but otherwise provide notice as set forth above, the modified version of this Agreement will become effective fourteen days after we have posted the modified Agreement and provided you notification of the modifications. Your use of the Services following that period constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified. If you do not agree to the modifications, you are not permitted to use, and should discontinue your use of, the Services. Note that, if you have prepaid for any Paid Services (as defined below) prior to a modification of this Agreement, your use of such prepaid Paid Services is governed by the version of this Agreement in effect at the time Tumblr received your prepayment. As Tumblr grows and improves, we might have to make changes to these Terms of Service. When we do, we'll let you know. We're also going to make it a practice to post old versions so it's easy to see changes/additions/deletions. To see old versions, scroll down to the end of this document. 3. Use of the Services Eligibility: You may not use the Services, provide any personal information to Tumblr, or otherwise submit personal information through the Services (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number, or email address) if you are under the Minimum Age. The Minimum Age is (i) thirteen (13), (ii) sixteen (16) for users in the European Union or the United Kingdom, or (iii) eighteen (18) for certain features. You may only use the Services if you can form a binding contract with Tumblr and are not legally prohibited from using the Services. You have to be the Minimum Age to use Tumblr. We're serious: it's a hard rule. “But I’m, like, almost old enough!” you plead. Nope, sorry. If you're not old enough, don't use Tumblr. Ask your parents for a Playstation 4, or try books. Service Changes and Limitations: The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change without prior notice to you. Tumblr retains the right to create limits on and related to use of the Services in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice. Tumblr may also impose limits on certain Services or aspects of those Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. Tumblr may change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the availability of any product, feature, database, or Content (as defined below). Tumblr may also terminate or suspend Accounts (as defined below) at any time, in its sole discretion. Tumblr is an ever-evolving platform. With new products, services, and features launching all the time, we need flexibility to make changes, impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings (like features that flop). We can also terminate or suspend any account at any time. That sounds harsh, but we only use that power when we have a reason, as outlined in these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy , and our User Guidelines . Limitations on Automated Use: You may not, without express prior written permission, do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (a) tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, or the computer or delivery systems of Tumblr and/or its service providers; (b) probe, scan, or test any system or network (particularly for vulnerabilities), or otherwise attempt to breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (c) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Tumblr (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions) or unless permitted by Tumblr's robots.txt file or other robot exclusion mechanisms; (d) scrape the Services, and particularly scrape Content (as defined below) from the Services; (e) use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information, including without limitation by forging TCP-IP packet headers or email headers; or (f) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any other user of the Services, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a virus to, spamming, or overloading the Services, or by scripted use of the Services in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services. Don't do bad things to Tumblr or to other users. Some particularly egregious examples of \"bad things\" are listed in this section. Recommender Systems: For more information on how content is displayed in Tumblr's feeds and our use of recommender systems to show you content we think you'll love, please see this Help Center article . 4. Registration, Tumblr URLs, and Security As a condition to using certain of the Services and in order for us to provide them to you, you may be required to create an account (an \" Account \"), provide your age and an email address and select a password and Tumblr username, which will serve as a default link to your default Tumblr blog of the form [username].tumblr.com (a \" Tumblr URL \"). You must select a different Tumblr URL for each new blog you create. You agree to provide Tumblr with accurate, complete, and updated registration information, particularly your email address. It's really important that the email address associated with your Tumblr account is accurate and up-to-date. If you ever forget your password - or worse, fall victim to a malicious phishing attack - a working email address is often the only way for us to recover your account. You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account password and for the security of your Account, and you will notify Tumblr immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Account or Account password. 5. Privacy For information about how Tumblr collects, uses, and shares your information, please review our Privacy Policy . By using the Services you agree you have read the Privacy Policy, which describes our collection, use, and sharing (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of such information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing, and use by Tumblr and the Tumblr Affiliates (as defined below). 6. Content and User Content Definitions: For purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term \" Content \" means a creative expression and includes, without limitation, video, audio, photographs, images, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written posts, replies, comments, information, data, text, software, scripts, executable files, graphics, Themes (as defined below), and interactive features, any of which may be generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Services; (2) the term \" User Content \" means Content that you or any other user of the Services (collectively, a \" User \") submits, transfers, or otherwise provides to the Services. Content includes, without limitation, all User Content. Your Rights in User Content: Users retain ownership and/or other applicable rights in User Content, and Tumblr and/or third parties retain ownership and/or other applicable rights in all Content other than User Content. You retain ownership you have of any intellectual property you post to Tumblr. User Content License to Tumblr: When you provide User Content to Tumblr through the Services, you grant Tumblr a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Services are available), and create derivative works of, such User Content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purposes of allowing Tumblr to operate the Services in accordance with their functionality, improve and promote the Services, and develop new Services. The reference in this license to \"creat[ing] derivative works\" is not intended to give Tumblr a right to make substantive editorial changes or derivations, but does, for example, enable reblogging , which allows Tumblr Users to redistribute User Content from one Tumblr blog to another in a manner that allows them to add their own text or other Content before or after your User Content. When you upload your creations to Tumblr, you’re giving us permission to make them available in all the ways you would expect us to (for example, via your blog, RSS, the Tumblr Dashboard, etc.). We never want to do anything with your work that surprises you. Something else worth noting: Countless Tumblr blogs have gone on to spawn books, films, albums, brands, and more. Any royalties or reimbursement you get for your creations are, needless to say, entirely yours. It's your work, and we're proud to be a part (however small) of what you accomplish. You also agree that this license includes the right for Tumblr to make all publicly-posted Content available to third parties selected by Tumblr, so that those third parties can syndicate and/or analyze such Content on other media and services. An example of what it means to \"make all publicly-posted Content available\" to a Tumblr partner for distribution or analysis would be licensing the Tumblr \"firehose,\" a live feed of all public activity on Tumblr, to partners like search engines. Note also that this license to your User Content continues even if you stop using the Services, primarily because of the social nature of Content shared through Tumblr’s Services - when you post something publicly, others may choose to comment on it, making your User Content part of a social conversation that can’t later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of others. One thing you should consider before posting: When you make something publicly available on the Internet, it becomes practically impossible to take down all copies of it. You also agree that you will respect the intellectual property rights of others, and represent and warrant that you have all of the necessary rights to grant us this license for all User Content you provide. Tumblr may add its own affiliate code to links posted on Tumblr at its discretion, provided a user has not previously included their own affiliate code into the applicable link. Users may opt out of this functionality here . Content License to You: As a User of the Services, Tumblr grants you a worldwide, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license to download, store, view, display, perform, redistribute, and create derivative works of Content solely in connection with your use of, and in strict accordance with the functionality and restrictions of, the Services (including, without limitation, Paid Services, as defined below). This means, for example, that we license Content to you for purposes of reblogging. Compliance with User Guidelines: You agree that you won't violate Tumblr's User Guidelines . These Guidelines provide information on a few categories of content that are damaging to our community. If you violate the Guidelines, you may not be able to continue using Tumblr. Termination and Deletion: On termination of your Account, or upon your deletion of particular pieces of User Content from the Services, Tumblr shall make reasonable efforts to make such User Content inaccessible and cease use of it and, if required by the applicable Privacy Policy, delete your Account data and / or User Content unless permitted or required to keep this data in accordance with law; however, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) deleted User Content may persist in caches or backups for a reasonable period of time and (b) copies of or references to the User Content may not be entirely removed (due to the nature of reblogging, for example). You can delete your account at any time here . 7. Special Provisions for Application Developers If you develop software or services based on the Services or any Content, whether using the Tumblr Application Programming Interface or not, you will agree to and comply with the Tumblr Application Developer and API License Agreement . 8. Special Provisions for Advertising and Sponsored Content If you post or buy advertisements or sponsored Content, you must comply with our Global Advertising Policy 9. Use of Trademarks Any use of Tumblr's trademarks, branding, logos, and other such assets in connection with the Services shall use Tumblr’s approved branding and shall be in accordance with the Tumblr Trademark Guidelines . 10. Themes Tumblr makes available specialized HTML and CSS code (\" Tumblr Template Code \") for the design and layout of blog pages available for use on some of the Services (\" Themes \"). Certain Themes are available for purchase as a Paid Service (as defined below) (such Themes, \" Premium Themes \"). Purchased Premium Themes may not be transferred between Accounts, between blogs, or between Services on a single Account and are subject to the payment terms herein. Tumblr grants you a license to customize the Tumblr Template Code to create your own Themes for use on your blog page (each a \" Custom Theme \"). If you choose, you may also contribute your Custom Themes for use by other Users as User Content. However, as a condition of this license allowing you to create Custom Themes, you agree that you won't distribute such Custom Themes from locations other than Tumblr-owned or approved websites without our permission, as set out in our User Guidelines . Note also that other Users may use your Custom Themes after you have removed them from distribution, and you hereby grant those Users an irrevocable license to use those Custom Themes as contributed by you. In other words, you can remove and stop distribution of your Custom Themes, but Users who are already using them can keep using them. To develop and distribute Custom Themes that are Premium Themes, please contact us . 11. Paid Services Some of the Services require payment of fees (the \" Paid Services ,\" including without limitation Premium Themes, Blaze, and Subscriptions). All fees are stated in United States dollars. You shall pay all applicable fees, as described in the applicable Services, in connection with such Services, and any related taxes or additional charges. Paid Services are limited licenses for you to use particular for-pay aspects of the Services. Usage of terms like sell, sale, buy, purchase, or similar terms all refer to your acquisition of a license to use Paid Services, and do not represent any transfer of any right, title, or ownership interest of any kind. You may not relicense, resell, transfer, or exchange Paid Services within or outside of the Services, except as expressly allowed by the rules of those Paid Services. Tumblr may, in its sole discretion, modify the functionality of, or eliminate, Paid Services, or the terms and conditions under which Paid Services are provided. Purchases of Paid Services are final and non-refundable (particularly those Paid Services that may be used immediately, such as Promotions, as defined below), except at Tumblr's sole discretion and in accordance with the rules governing each Paid Service. Termination of your Account or your rights under this Agreement may result in forfeiture of purchased Paid Services. For example, if your Account is suspended, you forfeit your license to any Premium Themes you have purchased. Tumblr may change prices for Paid Services it provides at any time. To the extent applicable, Tumblr will provide you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable Paid Service and/or by sending you an email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices, you may choose not to purchase, or to cancel, the applicable Paid Service offered by Tumblr prior to the change going into effect. 12. Recurring Payments: Some Paid Services on Tumblr automatically renew as recurring subscriptions (“ Subscriptions ”). Subscriptions are charged on a monthly or yearly basis (“ Subscription Period ”) for the recurring amount shown to you when you enrolled (“ Subscription Fee ”). If you subscribed during a promotion, used a coupon code, or otherwise received a discount, your Subscription will automatically renew for the full Subscription Fee at the end of the discount period. By enrolling in a Subscription, you authorize the Subscription Fee (and any applicable taxes) to be automatically charged to your designated payment method at the beginning of each Subscription Period until you cancel the Subscription or payments are otherwise ended because the Subscription was terminated for other reasons. You must cancel your Subscription at least 14 days before the end of your current Subscription Period in order to avoid being charged for the next Subscription Period. If you enrolled through the Tumblr Site, you can modify your payment method or cancel your Subscriptions at: www.tumblr.com/settings/subscriptions . If you enrolled using an in-app payment platform, such as through an Apple or Android device, you must modify your payment method or cancel your Subscriptions directly with that platform. 13. Domain Names We may work with third-party registrars to provide domain name services. When you register a domain on Tumblr or transfer an existing domain to Tumblr, the policies of the respective registry apply, and you become bound by the relevant registrar’s terms and conditions. Depending on the domain, you may be subject to the terms of the Automattic Domain Name Registration Agreement , or the Key-Systems GmbH Registration Agreement , in addition to this Agreement. When you register a domain, you’re presented with and agree to the applicable domain registration agreement. If you didn’t make a note of it, please see the Domain Registration Agreements page to determine which domain registration agreements apply to you and your domains. These registrar terms are incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Your domain is also subject to the policies of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”), and you can read about your rights and responsibilities as a domain name registrant . When you register a domain, you’re required to provide complete and accurate registration information, and you must keep this information current. For more information about your domain registration, like associated fees, how to update your contact information, or what happens during the domain expiration process, please see the Domains support doc . 14. Warranty Disclaimer; Services Available on an \"AS IS\" Basis Your access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TUMBLR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. Tumblr makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to the Services, including any representation or warranty that the use of the Services will (a) be timely, uninterrupted or error-free or operate in combination with any other hardware, software, system, or data, (b) meet your requirements or expectations, (c) be free from errors or that defects will be corrected, (d) be free of viruses or other harmful components; or (e) be entirely secure or that the information you share with us will be secure. Tumblr also makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to Content; User Content, in particular, is provided by and is solely the responsibility of, the Users providing that Content. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Tumblr or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein. 15. Time Limitation on Claims and Releases From Liability You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to this Agreement or your relationship with Tumblr must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred. You further release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Tumblr and its employees, agents, consultants, directors, shareholders, any other person or entity that directly or indirectly controls, is under common control with, or is directly or indirectly controlled by, Tumblr (the “Tumblr Affiliates”) from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including but not limited to claims of negligence), arising out of or related to the following: Disputes between Users, including those between you and other Users. The acts of third parties generally (i.e., individuals or entities who are not Tumblr or a Tumblr Affiliate), including third party sites and services. Disputes concerning any use of or action taken using your Account by you or a third party. Claims relating to the unauthorized access to any data communications relating to, or Content stored under or relating to, your Account, including but not limited to unauthorized interception, use, or alteration of such communications or your Content. For the sake of clarity, this includes any and all claims related to the security of your Account credentials. Claims relating to any face-to-face meetings in any way related to Tumblr at any venues (\" Meetups \"), including without limitation claims related to the actions or omissions of any Users or third parties who organize, attend, or are otherwise involved in any Meetups. Unless otherwise expressly disclosed in writing, Tumblr does not sponsor, oversee, or in any manner control Meetups. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code § 1542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\" 16. Limitation of Liability TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TUMBLR AND THE TUMBLR AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER; (B) LOSS OF: PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES; (C) DAMAGES RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (D) DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY OR USER USING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OR CONTENT; AND/OR (E) DAMAGES IN ANY MANNER RELATING TO ANY CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT TUMBLR HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND FURTHER WHERE A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF TUMBLR AND THE TUMBLR AFFILIATES, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (US $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S). 17. Exclusions to Warranties and Limitation of Liability Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion/limitation of liability as set forth in Section 13 and 15, so the limitations above may not apply to you. 18. Termination Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying the other party. Tumblr may terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. In particular, Tumblr may immediately terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged for repeat copyright infringement. Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Termination of your access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability that you otherwise may have to Tumblr or any third party and shall not relieve you of your rights if you are a user in the European Economic Area which are described in the Privacy Policy. 19. Choice of Law and Venue You and Tumblr agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or the Services in accordance with this Section or as you and Tumblr otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to formal dispute resolution, we strongly encourage you to contact us to seek a resolution. Law and Forum for Legal Disputes: This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York between New York residents, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Tumblr must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York County, New York, except as otherwise agreed by the parties. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York County, New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. If you are (a) a United States federal, state, or local government agency or body, (b) using the Services in your official capacity, and (c) legally unable to accept the clauses in this Section, then this Section doesn’t apply to you. For such entities, this Agreement and any related action will be governed by the laws of the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law provisions, and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of New York, excluding choice of law. 20. Miscellaneous This Agreement, as modified from time to time, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Tumblr with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the parties. The failure of either party to exercise, in any way, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain enforceable and in full force and effect. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with Tumblr's prior written consent. Tumblr may assign this Agreement in whole or in part at any time without your consent. No agency, partnership, joint controllership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Tumblr in any respect whatsoever. Any notice to Tumblr that is required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon receipt, when delivered in person by nationally recognized overnight courier or mailed by first class, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to Tumblr, Inc. (Automattic) 60 29th Street #343 San Francisco, CA 94110 Attn: Legal Department 21. Special Provisions for Users Located Outside of the United States Tumblr provides global products and services and enables a global community for individuals to share and follow the things they love. Tumblr's servers and operations are, however, located in the United States, and Tumblr's policies and procedures are based on United States law. As such, the following provisions apply specifically to Users located outside of the United States: (1) you acknowledge that we will transfer, store, and process your information, including but not limited to User Content and any personal information, in the United States and/or other countries in order to provide you with the Services and perform this Agreement; and (2) if you are using the Services from a country embargoed by the United States, or are on the United States Treasury Department's list of \"Specially Designated Nationals,\" you agree that you will not engage in financial transactions, or conduct any commercial activities using or through the Services (for example, purchasing Premium Themes). Submit an infringement notice 22. DMCA Copyright Policy Tumblr has adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement on the Services in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the \" DMCA \"). The address of Tumblr's Designated Agent for copyright takedown notices (\" Designated Agent \") is listed below. You may submit a notice under the DMCA using our copyright notice form . Reporting Instances of Copyright Infringement: If you believe that Content residing or accessible on or through the Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent at the address below: Identification of the work or material being infringed. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including its location, with sufficient detail so that Tumblr is capable of finding it and verifying its existence. Contact information for the notifying party (the \"Notifying Party\"), including name, address, telephone number, and email address. A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed. Please also note that the information provided in a notice of copyright infringement may be forwarded to the User who posted the allegedly infringing content. After removing material pursuant to a valid DMCA notice, Tumblr will immediately notify the User responsible for the allegedly infringing material that it has removed or disabled access to the material. Tumblr will terminate, under appropriate circumstances, the Accounts of Users who are repeat copyright infringers, and reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate any User for actual or apparent copyright infringement. Submitting a DMCA Counter-Notification: If you believe you are the wrongful subject of a DMCA notification, you may file a counter-notification with Tumblr by providing the following information to the Designated Agent at the address below: The specific URLs of material that Tumblr has removed or to which Tumblr has disabled access. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or the federal district courts located in New York County, New York if your address is outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original DMCA notification or an agent of such person. The following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\" Your signature. Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, Tumblr will forward it to Notifying Party who submitted the original DMCA notification. The original Notifying Party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then have ten (10) days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action relating to the allegedly infringing material. If Tumblr does not receive any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material to the Services. Designated Agent Tumblr, Inc.

I truly would love to be able to use them with it, and I am sure there will be enough interest to even make some coins out of them... I am a fan! :-) I answered: Hi! Thank you! Many apologies for the late response, I completely missed this message. I probably won’t ever port these themes over to any SSG, simply out of disinterest 😅 they’re very old and if I were to make an SSG theme, it’d be completely new. That said, you (or anyone) are welcome to do it yourself if you like, so long as you do not monetize it, and you provide attribution somewhere.

              "content": "new theme: olivia ( preview | install | customization guide ) I’m so excited to release this!!! it is very light on the features—you can change the colours and font, and that’s about it. there’s lots of padding and whitespace, and the font size is deliberately big. everything about this is big and dramatic. posts are 700px wide. it’s one column. it’s got diamonds. I hope you like it. Eliza - preview | install | customization guide Some features: responsive layout header image left/right sidebar option 540/700px wide post option show/hide tags on index page Disqus HAHA, ABOUT TIME I FINISHED THIS. This kind of feels like a mashup of my three other themes, but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ One of my main focuses this time around was usability, and finding the balance between being feature-rich and also simple to use. I’m not quite sure if I’ve succeeded, so I welcome any thoughts/comments you may have on that! Questions can be directed to my support blog ; customization requests may not be answered, depending on complexity. And lastly, Eliza is named after Eliza Hamilton, from Hamilton: An American Musical, a major creative inspiration over the past few months . blogroll page ( preview | code ) someone asked me if I’ve made a blogroll page, and I haven’t for this blog but they’re simple enough that I decided to throw one together :D about the page: content is 900px wide (& will automatically resize on smaller screens) header default height is 300px, change it to whatever you want (or remove it altogether if you’d like) the header image in this preview is by Namphuong Van I encourage you to make use of online resources before asking any questions on customization: W3Schools is a thorough HTML/CSS reference Googling your question will more often than not give you the exact answer you’re looking for (eg. ‘how do I make a full-sized background fit?’ or ‘how do I make a link open in a new tab?’ etc. etc.) misc. info/tips: check out unsplash for high-res, free photos to use for your header compress your header image , especially if using a high-res photo in order to improve load time note that blogroll pages will only work on your primary blog and not side blogs I’ve included a dashboard link in the nav bar because blog pages don’t display follow/dashboard buttons in the top right-hand corner instructions on how to install it are below the cut: Nyssa - preview | install | customization guide Some features: responsive layout left/right sidebar Google font this took me an obscenely long time despite how simple it is, but I’m pretty happy with how it turned out! The design is based on a theme I made way back last year, but upgraded to be responsive and customizable (ง︡’-‘︠)ง Rue is a clean theme featuring a big header image. Preview it here . Some features: header image one column posts + sidebar—the sidebar gets pushed to the bottom of the page when your window is small as many custom links as you want! Check out the customization guide for a full list. Erin ( preview | install ) Erin is a cute and compact theme built for any kind of blogger. Some features: responsive layout left/right and fixed sidebar option as many custom links as you want! See the Customization Guide for a full list.",
