Will the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) hire me or provide information on a specific job for me? BLS hires primarily economists, mathematical statisticians, and information technology specialists. Information on job vacancies at BLS and how to apply for them may be found at USAJobs . BLS resources related to job-search information, such as career exploration, are available on the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) \" How to find a job \" page. Additional career information is available through online sources from the U.S. Department of Labor. For example, DOL’s CareerOneStop site includes the following links: Explore Careers , which allows you to learn about occupations and industries, watch videos about skills or careers, and find a career that matches your interests, skills, and values Find Training , which explains the different types of education and training, how to pay for training, and training choices Job Search , which allows you to search for jobs in any location across the United States and provides information on networking, resumes, interviews, and other tips to help you find a job Find Local Help , which allows you to search for workforce services in your neighborhood or across the country If you are not a U.S. citizen, you should check immigration rules with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services before attempting to get a job in the United States. How can I learn about an occupation that is of interest to me? The Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) provides information on what workers do; the work environment; education, training, and other qualifications; pay; the job outlook; information on state and area data; similar occupations; and sources of additional information for more than 300 occupational profiles covering about 4 out of 5 jobs in the economy. The OOH is broken up into clusters of similar occupations. In order to find an occupation, browse the occupation groups of interest on the left-hand side of the homepage, or use the A–Z Index if you know the specific occupation. You may search for occupations by using the selector drop-down menus on the OOH homepage. Select by pay range, entry-level education, on-the-job training, projected number of new jobs, or projected growth rate. If you know the specific occupation you are interested in, you may enter a job title into the “Search Handbook” box on the top right-hand side of the homepage. In addition, you may browse by clicking any of the four links titled “ highest paying ,” “ fastest growing (projected),” “ most new jobs (projected),” and “ field of degree .” Although hundreds of occupations are covered in detail in the OOH , BLS publishes information on additional occupations for which the required education, training, median wages, and employment projections are prepared but detailed occupational information is not developed. What if I can't find the occupation I am interested in? Many occupations and job titles are covered in th e Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ). If you cannot find an occupation that you are interested in, look under the A–Z index to search for an occupation using similar titles. Or you can simply search for your occupation by entering the title into the “Search Handbook” box at the top of the page. The OOH includes occupations that are defined in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System, which is used by federal statistical agencies to classify workers into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data. In addition, Career Outlook , published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, features employment projections in articles about occupations . Career Outlook articles also highlight projections data, unusual occupations, and interviews with workers. What occupation would be best for me? The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not provide specific career guidance or advice. Nevertheless, the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) profiles do provide general information on the education and training typically needed to enter occupations. To learn about employment growth and job prospects, you are encouraged to read the “Job Outlook” section of occupations that interest you. You also may use the Occupation Finder navigation tool featuring drop-down menus to search for occupations by pay range, entry-level education, on-the-job training, projected number of new jobs, or projected growth rate. BLS resources related to job-search information, such as career exploration, are available on the OOH \" How to find a job \" page. Career information also is available through online sources from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). For example, DOL's CareerOneStop site includes the following links: Explore Careers , which allows you to learn about occupations and industries, watch videos about skills or careers, and find a career that matches your interests, skills, and values Find Training , which explains the different types of education and training, how to pay for training, and training choices Job Search , which allows you to search for jobs in any location across the United States and provides information on networking, resumes, interviews, and other tips to help you find a job Find Local Help , which allows you to search for workforce services in your neighborhood or across the country If you are not a U.S. citizen, you should check immigration rules with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services before attempting to get a job in the United States. Does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have employment information for states or local areas? Employment data for states and local areas are available from several BLS programs. Employment data by occupation for states and local areas are available from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program. Each profile in the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) has a “State and Area Data” section with links to OEWS data and resources for states and areas. Current employment data by industry for states and metropolitan areas are available from the Current Employment Statistics (State and Metro Area) (CES-SAE) program. Local area unemployment statistics are available from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program. The BLS Geographic Guide for Employment and Unemployment contains a comprehensive list of available information by geography. Where can I find state resources on occupations and labor markets? While the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) provides projected employment growth at the national level, each state’s Employment Security Agency develops and provides state occupation projections. These projections—as well as the links to each of the states’ Labor Market Information websites , which contain information on that state’s employment, unemployment, and wages—are available from Projections Central . The “State and Area Data” section within each OOH profile contains links to resources for state and area data. Where can I find more detailed data? The Employment Projections (EP) program has detailed downloadable data on projected employment by occupation . In addition, tables 1.8 and 1.9 show National Employment Matrix base-year and projected employment for each occupation by industry and for each industry by detailed occupation. The EP homepage also has links to more detailed data on the aggregate economy , labor force , industry output and employment , and skills . Methodology on occupational separations is available and tables 1.2 and 1.10 include these data in addition to projections of new jobs. The Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly survey of households, has data on employment by detailed occupation, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. The CPS uses an occupational classification different from that of the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey, and the OEWS is the primary source of employment data for the Occupational Outlook Handbook . Therefore, the coverage of some occupations may not match between the two sources. Data on unemployment, prices, and other labor statistics-related topics are available from other BLS programs. BLS programs by subject area are available on the Subject Areas homepage . I do not think my employer is treating me fairly. What can I do? Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not have information regarding your legal employment rights, you can visit the Department of Labor’s compliance assistance website . Employment estimates and growth Back to top What are the fastest growing occupations? Which occupations are adding the most new jobs? What is the difference between “fastest growing occupations” and “occupations adding the most new jobs?” What are the fastest growing industries? Does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have data on projected employment growth for states or geographic areas? Does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have employment estimates by state or geographic area? Does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have more details on projected employment growth? Why might there be a difference between estimated employment in a particular occupation in the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) and estimated employment in that same occupation from surveys such as the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey or the Current Population Survey (CPS)? What are the fastest growing occupations? The table of fastest growing occupations shows the occupations that are projected to have the highest percent increase in employment over the projections decade. Which occupations are adding the most jobs? The table of occupations with the most job growth shows the occupations that are projected to add the most new jobs over the projections decade. What is the difference between “fastest growing occupations” and “occupations adding the most new jobs”? Projected employment can be viewed in two ways: as percent change and as numeric change. BLS has two tables that illustrate these different approaches. The table of fastest growing occupations shows the occupations that are projected to have the highest percent increase in employment over the projections decade. The table of occupations with the most job growth shows the occupations that are projected to add the most new jobs over the projections decade. The occupations in these tables are different because a fast rate of employment growth does not always translate into many new jobs. For example, employment of occupation “A” is 2,000 and is projected to grow 20 percent. Because of the occupation’s relatively small size, this percent growth accounts for only 400 new jobs over the projections decade. In contrast, employment of occupation “B” is one million and is projected to grow 5 percent. The large size of occupation “B” will still result in 50,000 new jobs over the decade despite the lower growth rate. What are the fastest growing industries? The table of fastest growing industries shows the industries that are projected to have the largest percent growth in employment over the projections decade. Does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have data on projected employment growth for states or geographic areas? The BLS provides data on projected employment growth at the national level. State projections are developed and provided by each state’s Employment Security Agency and are available from Projections Central . Does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have employment estimates by state or geographic area? The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for more than 800 occupations. These estimates are available for the nation as a whole, for individual states, and for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Each profile in the Occupational Outlook Handbook has a “State and Area Data” section that contains links to OEWS data for states and areas. Does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have more details on projected employment growth? The Employment Projections (EP) program has detailed downloadable data on projected employment by occupation . In addition, tables 1.8 and 1.9 show National Employment Matrix base-year and projected employment for each occupation by industry and for each industry by detailed occupation. The EP homepage also has links to more detailed data on the aggregate economy , labor force , industry output and employment , and skills . Methodology on occupational separations is available and tables 1.2 and 1.10 include these data in addition to projections of new jobs. Why might there be a difference between estimated employment in a particular occupation in the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) and estimated employment in that same occupation from surveys such as the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey or the Current Population Survey (CPS)? Employment for a particular occupation in the OOH represents total employment for all classes of workers—wage and salary, self-employed, and unpaid family workers—from the BLS National Employment Matrix, which combines employment data from several different sources. Data in the matrix come primarily from the establishment-based OEWS survey, which reports employment of wage and salary workers only, for each occupation in every industry except agriculture and private households. Matrix data also come from the household-based CPS, which provides information on the number of self-employed and unpaid family workers in each occupation. In addition, the matrix incorporates CPS employment data for all classes of workers in the agriculture and private household industries. How does BLS prepare projections?

Technical documentation on employment projections is available in the Employment Projections: Handbook of Methods . Where can I find the ONET-SOC-to- OOH crosswalk? The ONET-SOC-to- OOH crosswalk is available on the BLS website on the Classifications and Crosswalks page. Information included in the Occupational Outlook Handbook Back to top What information is included in the occupational profiles in the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH )? What are the definitions of the key phrases used to describe projected changes in employment for 2024–34? Are all occupations included in the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) ? What information is included in the occupational profiles in the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH )? See Occupational Information Included in the OOH for information on what is included in each section, or page, of OOH profiles. What are the definitions of the key phrases used to describe projected changes in employment? The definitions of the key phrases used in the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) are as follows: Changing employment between 2024 and 2034 If the statement reads— Employment is projected to— Grow much faster than the average increase 7 percent or more Grow faster than the average increase 5 percent to 6 percent Grow about as fast as the average increase 3 percent to 4 percent Grow slower than the average increase 1 percent to 2 percent Little or no change increase less than 1 percent to decrease less than 1 percent Decline decrease 1 percent or more Are all occupations included in the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH )? BLS publishes projections for more than 800 detailed occupations that are included in the Standard Occupational Classification System (SOC). The OOH includes detailed information on about 600 occupations in more than 300 OOH profiles, which covers about 4 out of 5 jobs in the economy. Limited information, including wage data, base-year employment, and projected-year employment, is available for the remaining occupations that are not covered in detail . Pay Back to top Where can I find more information on occupational pay? How do I find starting-salary information? Is information on pay by education or experience level available? What are the highest paying occupations? Where can I find more information on occupational pay? The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces wage estimates annually for more than 800 occupations. OEWS wage estimates represent wages and salaries only, and do not include nonproduction bonuses or employer costs for nonwage benefits, such as health insurance or employer contributions to retirement plans. Self-employed people are not included in the estimates. Estimates are available for the nation as a whole , for individual states , and for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas . National occupational wage estimates for specific industries also are available. Additional information for these estimates, including hourly and annual 10th-, 25th-, 75th-, and 90th-percentile wage data, is available in downloadable Excel files found on each page. How do I find starting-salary information? The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not collect data on starting salaries. Is information on pay by education or experience level available? This chart shows median annual earnings by educational attainment. The data are from the Current Population Survey (CPS). They reflect the highest level of education that a worker has attained. They do not take into account completion of training programs in the form of apprenticeships and other on-the-job training, which also may influence earnings and unemployment rates. The “How to Become One” sections in the Occupational Outlook Handbook profiles do provide information on the education and training typically needed to enter occupations. What are the highest paying occupations? This table shows the 20 occupations with the highest median annual earnings. Education, training, and licensing Back to top Where can I find a school that offers the training or education I need to enter this occupation? What courses should I take to enter this occupation? Does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have information on licensing requirements? Where can I find a school that offers the training or education I need to enter this occupation? The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not have information on specific providers of education or training. However, CareerOneStop: Find Training has information on available training programs, colleges, and universities in your local area for the occupation you are interested in. What courses should I take to enter this occupation? Most occupational profiles in the Occupational Outlook Handbook ( OOH ) describe the general educational preparation typical among those who enter the occupation. This information is available under the “How to Become One” section in each OOH profile. Some profiles include information on helpful coursework. Does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have information on licensing requirements? Beyond the general information on licensing presented in the “How to Become One” sections of some Occupational Outlook Handbook profiles, BLS does not have information on specific licensing requirements because those requirements often vary by state. However, CareerOneStop: License Finder allows you to search for occupational licensing requirements by state, occupation, or agency.

The website must provide at least one of the following: Education and training information Statistics about the occupation or industry Licensure, certification, and/or registration information or requirements Information on job specialties/types of the occupation Why does the OOH no longer link to professional associations, nonprofit organizations, and other nongovernmental sources? Historically, the OOH has provided links to nongovernmental sources of information; however, with the 2024–34 release, BLS decided to remove those links. Reasons for this change include the ease with which customers are now able to access a multitude of information sources on their own and the burden on staff to research and verify large numbers of outside sources.

Although these references were carefully compiled, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) cannot guarantee the accuracy of information or publications provided by these sources. Each governmental source has sole responsibility for the information it issues. The OOH describes the job outlook over a projected 10-year period for occupations across the nation; consequently, short-term labor market fluctuations and regional differences in job outlook generally are not discussed. Similarly, the OOH provides a general, composite description of jobs and cannot be expected to reflect work situations in specific establishments or localities. The OOH , therefore, is not intended to, and should never, be used for any legal purpose. For example, the OOH should not be used as a guide for determining wages, hours of work, the right of a particular union to represent workers, appropriate bargaining units, or formal job evaluation systems. Wage data in the OOH should not be used to compute the future loss of earnings in adjudication proceedings involving work injuries or accidental deaths. BLS has no role in establishing educational, licensing, or practicing standards for any occupation; any such standards are merely reported by BLS in the OOH . The education information in the OOH presents the typical requirements for entry into the given occupation and does not describe the education and training of those individuals already employed in the occupation. In addition, education requirements for occupations may change over time and often vary by employer or state. Therefore, the information in the OOH should not be used to determine if an applicant is qualified to enter a specific job in an occupation.

Classification Systems Industry sectoring plan ( XLSX ) This classification system is used for projections of: Commodity and industry output Industry employment The system uses definitions found in the 2022 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). More information about the NAICS is available from the Census Bureau at: https://www.census.gov/naics/ . NOTE: Industries in this system are limited to sectors for which EP projects output. EP publishes industry employment for additional sectors in the National Employment Matrix (see Industry employment directory below). Industry employment directory ( XLSX ) To develop the National Employment Matrix industry structure, EP combines the structures used to report estimates from the Current Employment Statistics (CES), the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS), and Current Population Survey (CPS) programs. Data from OEWS, CES, and CPS used to construct the matrix are crosswalked to the 2022 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

Beyond the Numbers What’s behind the projected construction employment growth from 2023 to 2033? This Beyond the Numbers article explores construction employment growth trends resulting from the expansion of renewable energy, the increasing need for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, and an expanding electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. Monthly Labor Review Incorporating AI impacts in BLS employment projections: occupational case studies This article presents several case studies illustrating how the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics incorporates the potential labor market impacts of artificial intelligence in its occupational employment projections. Spotlight on Statistics Economic trends: home and community-based care versus institution-based care As the population ages, the workforce that provides long-term services and support to elderly people—as well as those with disabilities and others needing assistance—has grown considerably. Traditionally, much of this care has been provided in institutional settings, such as nursing homes. However, many people prefer to age in place, both because they wish to remain in their homes and because it may be less expensive.

Let’s take a closer look at the wages and employment of those who keep us safe while we enjoy our fun in the sun. Beyond the Numbers Employment and wages for alternate definitions of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations Analyzing data for STEM occupations can be challenging because many definitions of STEM exist. This Beyond the Numbers (BTN) article provides research and analysis of STEM occupations by presenting employment and wage data for different definitions of STEM, based on options for defining STEM developed by the interagency SOCPC. This article uses a special tabulation of May 2023 OEWS data to look at national STEM employment and wages for alternate SOCPC definitions. Spotlight on Statistics A Look at Jobs Paying Less Than $15.00 Per Hour In response to the Great Depression, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 instituted numerous labor law reforms. These reforms included establishing a federal minimum wage of $0.25 per hour ($5.49 per hour in today’s dollars). The minimum wage was later increased, and its scope extended to cover more workers. The most recent update, bringing the federal minimum wage up to its current value of $7.25 per hour, became effective 15 years ago in 2009. Info For Survey Participants Respondents homepage.",

Work Environment Network and computer systems administrators work for a variety of organizations, including computer systems design firms, schools, and financial institutions. Most work full time, and some work more than 40 hours per week. Administrators may work evenings, nights, and weekends to monitor, maintain, or update networks and systems. How to Become a Network and Computer Systems Administrator To enter the occupation, network and computer systems administrators typically need a bachelor’s degree in a field related to computer or information science. Pay The median annual wage for network and computer systems administrators was $96,800 in May 2024. Job Outlook Employment of network and computer systems administrators is projected to decline 4 percent from 2024 to 2034. Despite declining employment, about 14,300 openings for network and computer systems administrators are projected each year, on average, over the decade. All of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to other occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.

Available in more than 80 languages, all rightsholders have access to the webform, which we’ve built as a streamlined and efficient way to submit copyright removal requests. **What does it do? ** Rightsholders enter a few details of their request, which is then reviewed by YouTube to see if it meets legal requirements for removing the reported content. Rights holders have access to powerful features, including the ability to ask YouTube to automatically prevent copies of the removed content from being reuploaded. Who’s it for? It helps creators and rights holders protect their content by automatically finding videos that are the same or very similar to ones previously uploaded. What does it do? If a match is found, the creator or the rights holder is notified. She can then review the video that potentially reused their content and decide whether to request the video’s removal. Who’s it for? Rightsholders who have the most complex rights management needs and experience heavy reposting of copyrighted material, like movie studios and music labels. What does it do? Rightsholders can pre-determine rules for when content matches are found — choosing to block a whole video from being viewed, monetize the video by running ads against it, or track the video’s viewership stats. How YouTube Addresses Copyright Claims Appeals The majority of copyright claims and removal requests on YouTube come from our automatic detection technology. We empower uploaders to report wrongful takedown requests, and we measure how often creators push back against removals and Content ID claims in our Copyright Transparency Report . Of the more than 1 billion Content ID claims made between July 2023 and December 2023, fewer than 1% have been disputed. Over 65% of those disputes succeeded, because claimants either voluntarily released the claim or did not respond within the 30-day window, resulting in the claim’s release. ( Source ) Explore more",

              "content": "Our Policies jump to a section How Community & Ad-Friendly Guidelines work Our policies help us maintain a responsible business that viewers, creators, and advertisers can rely on in order to continue to thrive on YouTube. As with any system, we sometimes make mistakes. That’s why appeals are an important part of our processes. Creators are notified when their videos are removed due to policy violations or when they may be suspended from YPP, and can appeal if they disagree with our decision. Our Community Guidelines and Advertiser-Friendly Content Guidelines are what enable us to strike this balance. Content that violates our community guidelines is flagged by a mix of automated detection and human reporting — most is automatically detected — and we go to great lengths to make sure violative content isn’t widely viewed, or even viewed at all, before it’s taken down. Exceptions can be made when content has a clear educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA) context. Brands rely on us to protect their business interests when they’re advertising on YouTube. To help support this, we have a set of Ad-Friendly guidelines creators in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) need to follow in order to have Ads served on their channel content and earn a share of the revenue. How we support creators Since 2007, we’ve been paying eligible creators every month through our revenue-sharing model, the YouTube Partner Program . For a creator to be eligible for YPP, they must meet a higher bar for what they share on YouTube. Creators have to follow YouTube monetization policies and we review each applicant’s channel before admitting them to YPP. We also demonetize videos that violate our Advertiser Friendly Guidelines, and suspend creators from YPP for repeat offenses.
