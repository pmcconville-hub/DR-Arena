Author: Kevin Kuschel Reading time: 19 mins When getting into composing orchestral music, there's no way around sample libraries . No matter if you're just a hobbyist writing purely for pleasure or an aspiring film, TV, or video games composer: You need to look into this to get realistic orchestral sounds out of your computer. In this chapter, we'll: Learn what sample libraries are Explore how they work Look at the best orchestral sample libraries for beginners. Sample libraries are exciting, and composers love talking about them. So, let's find out what it's all about. Table of Contents What is an orchestral sample library? What is sampling in music? Sampler Articulations Articulation switching Dynamic layers and round robins Microphone positions Best paid sample libraries for beginners Free and low-budget orchestral sample libraries What is an orchestral sample library? In short, sample libraries are digital audio files that contain snippets (or samples) of real instruments played by professional musicians. And these audio files are programmed so you can play them with a MIDI keyboard. The orchestral sections in Hollywood movies are often recorded at famous studios with a particularly stunning sound. You may have heard of the legendary Abbey Road studio. When watching a film with a soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, John Williams, or Ennio Morricone, you're likely listening to a real orchestra recording. However, music in all sorts of media - from film and TV over video games to your favorite epic orchestral music playlist on Youtube - is not always recorded with a real orchestra. Instead, they used sampling technology . If you think about it, it makes sense. Not all projects have budgets to produce with a 100-piece orchestra, where the cost of each minute of finalized music is in the thousands. And even if it has, composers usually prepare everything on the computer beforehand to save precious (and expensive) recording time. So yes, there is no way around it. Need help choosing the best orchestral sample libraries for your needs? Book your personal sample library consultation. What Is Sampling In Music? In the context of a sample library, the term sampling refers to a process where every single note of an orchestral instrument is recorded and saved as an audio file. The goal is that you can ultimately reproduce the sound of that instrument on your computer. Here's how it works: A company hires the strings section of - for example - the London Symphony Orchestra with all its 30+ violin players, 12 violas, 10 cellos, and 8 double basses. Not just the instruments but the actual professional musicians. They set them up in a recording hall with carefully adjusted microphones. Then they start sampling: Every single possible note is played with various types of volume and playing techniques and painstakingly recorded. The players perform long notes and short accents, pluck the strings with their fingers or scratch them for spine-chilling horror effects. These techniques are also called articulations , one of the essential sample library terms. High-quality sample libraries have many types of articulations you can combine to reproduce a realistic sound. These thousands of audio files are then programmed and mapped, so you can play them with a keyboard to get the sound of an accurate orchestral strings section. This final result is the sample library that you can purchase. You can buy it directly from the sample library developer's websites or third-party resellers (e.g. Best Service ). Prices reflect the vast diversity in sample libraries, ranging from 0$ freebies to 1000$ flagship libraries. Sampler You need sampling software to use a sample library. It crosses the bridge between the individual audio files, and you play them with your MIDI controller. Kontakt Player (free) vs. Kontakt Full (paid) The most popular sampling software is Kontakt by Native Instruments, which is available in free and paid versions . With the free Kontakt Player , you can only load those sample libraries specifically developed for Kontakt Player. Kontakt Full libraries only load in a demo mode and stop working after 15 minutes. You might ask: \"Why would companies create sample libraries you can only play with the paid version of Kontakt?\" Because Native Instruments takes a significant license fee for making your sample library available to everyone. Usually, only the larger library developers can afford to pay this. Smaller devs usually develop for Kontakt Full. For most of us, Kontakt is an annoying thing to buy. It doesn't give us that rewarding feeling of a shiny new sample library. And yet: I consider Kontakt Full a standard investment for every composer because it opens up a world of high-quality niche libraries by smaller developers. There are true gems (e.g. the Ethera Gold series with arguably the best vocal libraries on the market). Other samplers Sample library developers have also started releasing their own samplers to have more freedom on how they want to host their sample libraries. Examples are the SINEplayer from Orchestral Tools or Spitfire Audio's sample player . Other free alternatives are Decent Sampler or Sforzando . Kontakt is definitely the industry standard as of now. Articulations Long articulations The most frequent long articulations found in sample libraries are: Legato : Smoothly connected notes played with a single bow stroke. It's often used to play melodies with a beautiful, smooth sound. Sustain : Long notes without the legato transitions of a single bow stroke. Tremolo : Tremolo is a very fast repeated note with no variation in pitch. It's perfect to create tension or anticipation. Usually refers to string instruments. Flutter tongue : Tremolo-like technique of brass and woodwind instruments repeating one note very fast. Trills : A trill is a rapid alternation between two notes, usually either a half step or a whole step apart. Larger intervals are possible. True Legato vs. Scripted Legato True Legato True legato is the most realistic-sounding type of orchestral sample library. It uses samples from real players and instruments to capture the complex nuances of actual performance. This makes it possible for true legato instruments to transition smoothly between notes without any noticeable \"glitching\" sounds at the point where notes change. Scripted Legato This legato type is created with scripting software that mimics the way real instruments play. It simulates legato transitions instead of recording them and does not produce such realistic-sounding results. It might be good enough in some situations, mainly when the instrument is not exposed in a solo line but buried in the mix. Short articulations The most commonly used short articulations are: Sforzando : A note is played with accent or emphasis. Staccato : A short note. Staccatissimo : A very short staccato note Spiccato : Produced by bouncing the bow off the string rather than pressing down. Sharp percussive sound. Repetition : Very fast notes by partial tongue technique in brass and woodwinds instruments. Pizzicato : The string is plucked with the finger for a soft percussive sound. Articulation Switching An instrument will likely play more than just one articulation throughout an orchestral piece. It might switch back and forth between long and short notes several times in a single melody line. Therefore, it's also essential to switch up articulations in your virtual performances. Applying staccato to some notes and staccatissimo or spiccato to others makes an accented line of short notes sound much more convincing than relying on the same articulation. There are 3 ways of achieving this. All 3 workflows are used among composers, and there's no right or wrong here. It's a matter of taste (and habit): Keyswitches Keyswitches trigger articulations with MIDI notes either played by your MIDI keyboard or programmed in the piano roll. Sample libraries with multiple articulations usually have their articulations mapped to keys in the piano's low register. This way, you can play a melody with your right hand and trigger articulations with your left hand while playing. However, this only works if your keyboard has enough keys to reach down to the very bottom notes. Else, you'll have to program the keyswitches afterward. Expression Maps, Sound Variations, BRSO Articulate, etc. Some DAWs come with features that make switching articulations easier. In Cubase, it's called Expression Maps ; Studio One brands it as Sound Variations . For FL Studio, there's a 3rd party plugin called BRSO Articulate . With such articulation mapping features, you can select notes in your melody and assign them to an articulation from a drop-down list. You can even assign those articulations to a hotkey and switch them with the push of a key (or a Stream Deck button). This is pretty convenient but also comes at a cost. You will have to set up these mappings for each of your orchestral libraries unless you purchase them separately or are lucky to find free ones made by the community. Products like Babylon Wave's Art Conductor offer them as presets. Personally, I use this method, and it saves me a lot of time. Separate tracks A third thing composers do to switch between the articulations of an orchestral instrument is to distribute notes to separate tracks per articulation . This way, no articulation has to be changed. The Legato track only has legato notes, and the Staccato track only has the staccato notes, etc. This saves you the trouble of programming keyswitches or setting up expression maps. However, the downside is that your MIDI notes are now spread up much more, making melody lines harder to edit. This method is also more taxing on your system as more instances of your sample libraries have to be loaded (one per articulation). Experiment with these three options and see what feels most natural for you. There's no right or wrong here. The more comfortable you feel with your workflow, the faster you can write music. Time is money! :-) Dynamic layers and Round Robins (RRs) Sample libraries with multiple dynamic layers are recorded with several intensities (\"dynamics\") per note. For example, a strings library with 4 dynamic layers may have one note recorded in pianissimo , piano , forte , and fortissimo . You can blend through all of these layers seamlessly with the mod wheel. Make sure that your sample libraries come with multiple dynamic layers, so you can phrase your melodies more expressively and ultimately more realistically. Round Robins Round-robin samples are another feature of orchestral sample libraries that allows you to get even more natural-sounding results when working in your DAW. A library has round robins when multiple takes of the same note are recorded. So that when you play the same note multiple times (especially in drums), you don't hear the same sample over and over again. Instead, you hear numerous variations of the same notes. This allows these samples to sound like they are being performed by real musicians with tiny sound inconsistencies. Without round robins, each note sounds 100% the same. Playing the exact same sample several times in rapid succession sounds robotic. This is called the \" machine gun effect \" and libraries with round robins prevent this effect from happening.

Microphone positions An orchestra's sound depends on many factors, including the hall, the instruments, and the musicians. As a result, the same orchestra can sound very different when recorded in different venues or with different equipment. A sample library's microphone positions make it sound close or far, narrow or wide. To give composers more tools to shape their sound, orchestral sample libraries come in multiple microphone positions . The most common are close , mid , and far . This allows you to mix the sounds together to get a more realistic mix of instruments playing at once. Mic positions significantly affect a sample library's file size. An infamous example is Spitfire Audio's BBCSO Pro with 20 different mic positions at over 600GBs. The reason for a library having multiple mic positions is that there are subtle differences in the sound of each of these positions. They can be used by a composer to go for a specific sound. Usually, libraries come with some form of close mic, a far mic, and a balanced mix. As a rule of thumb, close mic positions add more proximity and \"attack\" to the sound, while far or room mics add distance and \"blurriness.\" Orchestral snippet with close mics only (no reverb): Your browser does not support the audio element. Same snippet with far mics only (no reverb): Your browser does not support the audio element. Mic positions are handy: By balancing mic positions, you can move instruments to the front and back of your virtual space. However, if you're just starting out, I recommend you to go with the default mix first. Most orchestral libraries are recorded in situ with their original seating and, therefore, already well-balanced. For now, don't get lost in the details! :) There's always time to experiment with mic position adjustments once you are more familiar with all the steps of producing orchestral music. Best paid sample libraries for beginners \" What is the best orchestral sample library? \" is the most frequently asked question in every composer community. Ironically, mostly asked by beginners. And for a reason! Aspiring music producers don't want to go down the wrong route with purchase decisions they might regret later. Sample libraries are expensive. In response to that question, every experienced composer will tell you that it depends on what you are looking for. And that your skillset is what matters more. Professional composers make better-sounding tracks with 20-year-old samples than intermediates with the latest technology. Let's look at some sample libraries that can help you get started with orchestral music. I bought several orchestral sample libraries early in my composer journey, which were invaluable to me. Here is what worked well for me, but your needs may differ, so it's best to do your own research before making purchases. These libraries will be able to give you everything you need from a cinematic orchestra. From elusive and dreamy all the way up to epic and punchy, everything is possible. This is my personal subjective list and is documentation of what worked well for ME . You may have different needs and preferences, and it's best to do your own research before buying libraries. There are fantastic valid options by other developers, too. I will also name alternatives for each section that might work very well. You've been warned. All-in-one orchestra When I started my composer journey, I didn't know what style of orchestral music I would be doing. So, I wanted a modern sound that matched today's movie or video game production standards yet still offered enough versatility to explore more traditional orchestras. I needed to cover as much ground as possible, and an all-in-one orchestral library was the best solution to get started. First, I looked at Spitfire Audio Albion One because it was popular. Ultimately decided against it because I wanted control over each section in an orchestra. As a beginner in composing, I liked the freedom to apply what I learned about orchestration and instrumentation in my work. Not having complete control over section sizes would have limited this learning experience. Then just as I was researching, the perfect match for me was released: Nucleus by Audio Imperia . Nucleus has an impressive range of content and full section control over strings, brass and woodwinds, basic orchestral percussion, a choir, and a few capable solo instruments. There's even some cinematic sound design! It's all I needed to get started and more. A huge plus is its resource-friendliness . Nucleus runs well, even on most laptops. Two mix options for a modern (processed) and a more traditional sound are an excellent bonus for allowing me to experiment with both traditional and hybrid orchestral styles. Nucleus offers a full orchestra with a rich, modern sound and a simple yet effective workflow. One alternative to Nucleus would be Spitfire's BBC Symphony Orchestra Core . It captures a beautiful symphonic sound and offers complete section control with many articulations at a similar price point. Orchestral Tools Berlin Inspire serves a similar purpose. However, it offers less flexibility with the sections, using group patches like high and low strings. Compared to Nucleus, BBCSO and Berlin Inspire lean more towards the classical orchestral sound. All-in-one orchestras like Nucleus and BBCSO Core are perfect for getting you started. For cheaper options, Nucleus LITE and BBCSO Discover (FREE!) are great entry points into the orchestral range for a low price. Plus, they offer reasonable upgrade paths as your budget increases. You're already well-equipped to write high-quality orchestral music if you grab one of the flagship all-in-one orchestras. Learn your tools well, and you'll be able to write entire symphonies with Nucleus or BBC Symphony Orchestra alone. But let's go one step further and look at sample libraries for the dedicated instrument sections like strings, brass, woodwinds, etc. Strings After using Nucleus for a while, I wanted to enhance my favorite section—the strings. Everyone was talking about Cinematic Studio Strings at the time because it was new. After weeks of learning how to use it properly, I also started liking what I heard. Years later, that legato is still one of my go-to patches when composing strings arrangements in my orchestral tracks. Cinematic Studio Strings excels at its brilliant legato, romantic tone and highly consistent handling. The beautiful, romantic tone is consistent across all articulations and patches. Suppose you're using other Cinematic Studio Series products as well. In that case, there's beautiful connectivity between your different libraries. Pacific Ensemble Strings by Performance Samples is another great pick if you're looking for a large, symphonic sound with fantastic playability. Percussion I love my All-in-one orchestra Nucleus, but the variety of percussion instruments was limited. I wanted to write some epic stuff with taiko and tom ensembles, big bass drums, and energizing high percussion. When Damage 2 by Heavyocity came out—just when I felt ready for it—it was a no-brainer recommendation for the first versatile flagship percussion library. Damage 2 contains a wide variety of organic and world percussion instruments as well as epic cinematic drums with hybrid and industrial processing. I would recommend it as the first choice for a flagship percussion library. Damage features a huge range of organic and hybrid cinematic percussion. Its playable drums are laid out on an intuitive stage matrix (left to right, front to back) and can be repositioned with drag-and-drop. If you're looking for something less expensive but still extraordinary, I'd recommend Strezov Sampling's Percussion Essentials X3M . It's a compilation of Strezov's whole percussion range, from orchestral to ethnic to cinematic percussion (I reviewed it here ). I've also heard good things about Hans Zimmer Percussion if you want that big cinematic sound. Choir In the beginning, Nucleus is a great way to familiarize yourself with your choir section. But it's hard to beat Strezov's Choir Essentials for that price. It's a straightforward choir collection that gives you the basics you need at an incredibly affordable price. With true polyphonic legato for men and women, short syllables, a children's choir, and an energetic ensemble performance patch, Choir Essentials is popular among beginners. And you can get it for close to 100$ on sale. Check my video overview to hear it in action. Choir Essentials includes premium features like polyphonic true legatos and a children's choir at an affordable price. Suppose a traditional separation into Soprano, Tenor, Alto, and Bass (SATB) patches is not a strict necessity for you. In that case, Chorus by Audio Imperia is a fantastic workhorse. It might be the only bread-and-butter choir library you'll need (I made a video ). Brass Here's a great all-rounder: Cinematic Studio Brass . The concept of CSB is similar to that of the Cinematic Studio Strings: a versatile bread-and-butter library with a consistent sound, gorgeous legato, and all the necessary articulations in medium section size. Picking Cinematic Studio Brass was an easy decision for me at that time. To this day, it's an absolute staple in my orchestral template. Cinebrass by Cinesamples is a popular alternative to Cinematic Studio Brass if you're looking for a brighter, more Hollywood-style brass sound. A real heavy-hitter both in price and quality is Tom Holkenborg's Brass by Orchestral Tools. Woodwinds I didn't get into using dedicated woodwind samples for quite a while. I was delighted with the Nucleus winds as they served me well and started my orchestral writing journey. However, once I began using other libraries like Cinematic Studio Woodwinds , I achieved a more robust sound in terms of versatility and character. Cinematic Studio Woodwinds offers a better legato, more instruments, detail and dynamic layers than the woodwind patches of an all-in-one orchestra. Free and low-budget orchestral sample libraries Plenty of options are available even if you're a composer on a tight budget. This paragraph will present some of the best free and low-cost orchestral sample libraries . Spitfire LABS Spitfire Audio is well known for its high-quality sample libraries. LABS is Spitfire's ongoing series of completely free instruments. LABS contains a bit of everything, including orchestral instruments, synths, ambient and experimental textures, and folk and world instruments. There's some funky stuff in it! Spitfire Originals Spitfire Audio also offers an Originals series as a step-up from the free LABS. Originals are priced at £29 / 29€ / $29 and provide greater detail and better functionality than the free instruments. They refer to themselves as essential cinematic ingredients and come at a very affordable price. Orchestral Tools SINEfactory After releasing their own sampler SINE, Orchestral Tools established an ongoing stream of high-quality freebies called SINEfactory . These include a church organ, studio percussion, strings and woodwinds instruments, a ukulele, and many more :) Same story here as with LABS: You don't need any external sampler like Kontakt. The instruments all run within SINE, which is free. Heavyocity Foundations A little while ago, Heavyocity started a Foundations series of freebies that make you feel like you're playing a paid product. These run in the free Kontakt Player and combine organic instruments like a piano, a strings section, or a nylon guitar with their signature cinematic sound design. All in a highly polished user interface. All for free. Heavyocity Foundations offers a selection of high-quality freebies for cinematic scoring like Foundations Staccato Brass. Performance Samples Freebies Performance Samples has several free libraries in their catalog that make you wonder, \"WHY don't they sell them for money?!\". They're just so good. Performance Samples' freebies primarily include strings instruments like a solo violin and solo cello but also ensemble patches . Some of these samples simply haven't made it into a final product because they were re-recorded at some point. Others are limited (but useful!) demo patches of their flagship libraries. Conclusion Even though I believe each of the library picks in this chapter can become an invaluable tool for your own composer journey, know that the modern-day composer has a massive palette to choose from . Do your own research. Don't rely on me or anyone else to tell you what's good and bad. Get out there and listen to as many libraries as you can. Check out demos and watch YouTube videos. And be aware that Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) can seriously impact your mental health and wallet. The free and budget libraries I listed are perfect for building your sound palette and finding some true gems out there. They probably won't replace a comprehensive all-in-one orchestra or a professional section library , as they focus more on one specific function. But I can confidently say that these freebie series are all worth looking into and will significantly boost your selection of music production tools. Now that you understand the basics of articulations, dynamic layers, round robins, and mic positions, you know what to look for. Find the libraries that speak to you, and those are the ones you should buy.

Covering 95% of what you will ever need in choral scoring for all media types without any compromises in dynamic range (from soft and delicate to aggressive) thanks to the availability of individual and full sections including a children choir. This collection is the perfect entry point for new composers and producers starting out as well as veterans, who want to extend their scoring palette or need an easy to use choral scoring tool. Featuring three mic positions and our favorite choral samples recorded in an ambient concert hall. A \"ready to go\" tool for all situations. Performance Patches - Realistic sounding results within seconds! Something our entire choral range excels at is accessibility and getting realistic sounding choir lines within seconds. With our unique performance patches we managed to push this feature to another level. Performance Patches allow you to mockup your choir lines on the fly due to custom edits of the recordings to make them extremely playable, while maintaining their organic and raw tone. Choose between different mappings of the different choral sections to increase the playability even further and fit the outcome to the needs of your track. We built this patch, so it allows you to choose between playing the choir pre-arranged in octaves, divided into separate sections or with the natural overlapping ranges in mind. Our Velocity Dynamic Influencer allows you to determine the loudness of single chord notes by velocity, which makes highlighting certain notes within a chord easier than ever, while Modwheel CC1 still controls crossfading between the natural dynamic layers. The combination of both greatly enhances the expression you can get out of a regular keyboard performance. If you ever looked for a \"go-to\" playable choir patch. This is it! The most fluid Polyphonic True Legato Like our other libraries, Choir Essentials also has true legato patches that can be played polyphonically without issues and without complicated extra requirements - you just play the music you have in your head and you don't need to worry about anything else. Our intelligent voice leading enables polyphonic writing within just one patch. In other words: Hold down a chord with your left hand, play a melody with your right hand and have it all connected with legato transitions. This powerful feature is controllable by the most common of all midi cc controllers, the sustain pedal. Permanent Crossgrade Discounts from other products available upon Login. ESSENTIALS Bundle STORM CHOIR Ultimate FREYJA Female Choir WOTAN Male Choir ARVA Children Choir RHODOPE 2 Ethnic Bulgarian Choir Strezov Sampling has become my first choice for choir and percussion libraries which often play a big part in what I write. Great quality and most importantly, highly playable . Can’t wait to see what they come up with next! Neal Acree World of Warcraft, Overwatch These are the best choir Libraries I have found, for imagination and sound quality. Beautifully made and very Inspiring! Juno Reactor - Ben Watkins The Matrix Reloaded, Mortal Kombat Strezov Sampling choirs are the most realistic and emotive choir libraries around. Other professional choir libraries sometimes try to sound so epic that they end up sounding midi and processed while with Strezov I feel I can hear each vocalist in the mix somehow. Serj Tankian Composer, Songwriter, Singer: System of a Down As not all of our products come with unique serial numbers which you are to insert into Native Access, please pay close attention to the products' technical requirements sections - they can tell you if you can power a certain library through the free Kontakt Player, or if you need to purchase the retail version of Kontakt in order to use the library to its fullest potential (for instance - Architecture of Sound is meant only for the full Kontakt v5.7.1 or higher, while Storm Choir Ultimate can be powered through v5.7.1 or higher for both the full / paid Kontakt and the free Kontakt Player). Our libraries don't work in standalone mode without Native Instruments Kontakt, so you only need to pay attention to the required Kontakt / Kontakt Player version. If you can open Kontakt's respective version with your current OS, then you can be sure the library will work, as well. In the new version of our site, all our existing clients have profiles of their own, containing orders, download links for libraries and updates, personal / company information for invoicing, crossgrade options and gift cards. Try yours - we believe you will enjoy having everything in one place! :) If you haven't received a Native Access serial number with one of the confirmation emails we are sending out, then the library you have purchased is to be treated as \"third party\" - we can't provide serial numbers for those and so the products aren't visible in the standard \"library view\" of Kontakt. We can still offer you a workaround for the Strezov Sampling libraries you are using. Still have a questions?

There's plenty of characterful sounds, sometimes guttural with human imperfections, and other times precise and well recorded. Love this. Rupert Gregson-Williams \"Wonder Woman\", \"The Crown\", \"The Legend of Tarzan\" These are the best choir Libraries I have found, for imagination and sound quality. Beautifully made and very Inspiring! Juno Reactor - Ben Watkins The Matrix Reloaded, Mortal Kombat Storm Choir has a mighty sound that adds a real extra layer of intensity to proceedings. Not only that but it is extremely easy to use right out of the box. Job done! David Buckley Jason Bourne, Batman: Arkham Knight, The Sandman Strezov's AFFLATUS BRASS is my new front-line weapon for orchestral brass. The Velocity Dynamics Influencer feature is immediately useful in my workflow, and the ability to switch instantly between sustain, mono-legato, and poly-legato is another massively useful feature. And the sound is all I could hope for, from delicate to brutal, from intimate to massive, from up close to miles away. Supreme realism, instant playability, and world-class tone. A massive thumbs up!

There's plenty of characterful sounds, sometimes guttural with human imperfections, and other times precise and well recorded. Love this. Rupert Gregson-Williams \"Wonder Woman\", \"The Crown\", \"The Legend of Tarzan\" These are the best choir Libraries I have found, for imagination and sound quality. Beautifully made and very Inspiring! Juno Reactor - Ben Watkins The Matrix Reloaded, Mortal Kombat Storm Choir has a mighty sound that adds a real extra layer of intensity to proceedings. Not only that but it is extremely easy to use right out of the box. Job done! David Buckley Jason Bourne, Batman: Arkham Knight, The Sandman Strezov's AFFLATUS BRASS is my new front-line weapon for orchestral brass. The Velocity Dynamics Influencer feature is immediately useful in my workflow, and the ability to switch instantly between sustain, mono-legato, and poly-legato is another massively useful feature. And the sound is all I could hope for, from delicate to brutal, from intimate to massive, from up close to miles away. Supreme realism, instant playability, and world-class tone. A massive thumbs up!

A 20-piece chamber choir recorded with three microphone positions in Sofia Session Studio (the same hall where we recorded our Afflatus and Next Gen choir series). Completely new recordings ported within the powerful Syllabuilder engine, giving you the highest control possible on syllables, morphing, creating new words and polyphonic true legato.

It was inevitable that after the success of our Next Gen choir series (Wotan, Freyja, Arva, Rhodope 2) we had to upgrade Storm Choir (our most popular choir library) to be up to date with the rest of our choral libraries and to have the same features. Therefore we re-recorded everything, but this time with slightly bigger ensembles - 10 singers per section (men/women) for the syllables and 6 singers per section for the legatos. Again, we kept the same idea in mind - singing with exaggerated vibrato, over the top and generally - very loud. We re-recorded all 24 syllables of Storm Choir 2 in three dynamic layers, controllable with mod wheel (CC#1). The Performance Patch - Epic sounding results within seconds! Something the original Storm Choir excelled at was accessibility and getting epic sounding choir lines within seconds. For Storm Choir Ultimate we took the original concept and pushed it to new limits with the Performance patch. This patch allows you to perform your choir lines on the fly due to custom edits of the recordings to make them extremely playable, while maintaining their organic and raw tone. Choose between different mappings of the men and women section to increase the playability even further and fit the outcome to the needs of your track. We built this patch, so it allows you to choose between playing the choir pre-arranged in octaves, divided into separate sections or with the natural overlapping ranges in mind. Our Velocity Dynamic Influencer allows you to determine the loudness of single chord notes by velocity, which makes highlighting certain notes within a chord easier than ever, while Modwheel CC1 still controls crossfading between the natural dynamic layers. The combination of both greatly enhances the expression you can get out of a regular keyboard performance. If you ever looked for a \"go-to\" epic choir patch. This is it! Syllabuilder Engine 3.5 When it comes to virtual choirs, there are basically two approaches: Phrasebulding (Storm Choir legacy series) and Wordbuilding (Rhodope legacy series). Storm Choir Ultimate combines the simplicity and sample recording of phrasebuilding with the advanced editing functions of wordbuilding, the same our Next Gen choir libraries do. This allows you to have amazing sounding results within seconds, but also to build and create new sample content with only a few mouse-clicks (combine multiple syllables together, save them as presets, morph between vowels, combine staccato and sustain together, etc.). All samples have their natural attacks included. However, if you want to tighten them up, the Syllabuilder Engine allows you to set custom attack, release, volume and offset values for each field independently. Something completely new and greatly missed in all phrasebuilding choir libraries. You can also create complete choral patterns inside the GUI or connect different syllables and morph them to add motion to your choir arrangements. Save and Load complete lyric presets to quickly get yourself into the actual composition or enhance your setup with predefined quick words. The most fluid Polyphonic True Legato Like our other libraries, Storm Choir Ultimate also has true legato patches that can be played polyphonically without issues and without complicated extra requirements - you just play the music you have in your head and you don't need to worry about anything else. Also, our Syllabuilder engine has the Agile legato that gives you the option to cut off beginning consonants of syllables and to perform them as legato, again polyphonically. Our intelligent voice leading enables polyphonic writing within just one patch. In other words: Hold down a chord with your left hand, play a melody with your right hand and have it all connected with legato transitions. This powerful feature is controllable by the most common of all midi cc controllers, the sustain pedal. Breathtaking Soloists After we released Storm Choir 2, a lot of our users requested to have key singers available as soloist patches - this is why we have picked the ones with the most unique timbres and included them in the library - a total of 8 soloists with limited amount of syllables (12 instead of 24) that you can use either on their own, or as an \"overdub\" of the library - think of it as a \"first chair\" library for singers. Thunderous Effects, Whispers and Shouts The library also has a dedicated FX section, featuring whispers (in two dynamics - soft whisper and \"theatric\" whisper), shouts, clusters (multiple dynamics, ranges and vowels) and the traditional risers and falls. The whispers and shouts are included in a Syllabuilder patch that gives you the possibility to morph between syllables, to connect them and to create new words, patterns and effects really quickly. Includes Choir Midi files and Presets for The Lord of the Rings The Prophecy Mockup In the past we were often asked whether our choirs can deliver the feeling of The Lord of the Rings soundtrack. Being huge fans of the series, the original score inspired us to create choir libraries in the past and it's the same with this one. Therefore we decided to include the choir midi files for a mockup of The Prophecy from the Fellowship of the Ring movie. The presets are included in the download of the library.

CHOIR Collection AFFLATUS Chapter I Strings AFFLATUS Chapter II Brass Choir Essentials Storm Choir has a mighty sound that adds a real extra layer of intensity to proceedings. Not only that but it is extremely easy to use right out of the box. Job done! David Buckley Jason Bourne, Batman: Arkham Knight, The Sandman Strezov Sampling has become my first choice for choir and percussion libraries which often play a big part in what I write. Great quality and most importantly, highly playable . Can’t wait to see what they come up with next! Neal Acree World of Warcraft, Overwatch Strezov Sampling choirs are the most realistic and emotive choir libraries around. Other professional choir libraries sometimes try to sound so epic that they end up sounding midi and processed while with Strezov I feel I can hear each vocalist in the mix somehow. Serj Tankian Composer, Songwriter, Singer: System of a Down As not all of our products come with unique serial numbers which you are to insert into Native Access, please pay close attention to the products' technical requirements sections - they can tell you if you can power a certain library through the free Kontakt Player, or if you need to purchase the retail version of Kontakt in order to use the library to its fullest potential (for instance - Architecture of Sound is meant only for the full Kontakt v5.7.1 or higher, while Storm Choir Ultimate can be powered through v5.7.1 or higher for both the full / paid Kontakt and the free Kontakt Player). Our libraries don't work in standalone mode without Native Instruments Kontakt, so you only need to pay attention to the required Kontakt / Kontakt Player version. If you can open Kontakt's respective version with your current OS, then you can be sure the library will work, as well. In the new version of our site, all our existing clients have profiles of their own, containing orders, download links for libraries and updates, personal / company information for invoicing, crossgrade options and gift cards. Try yours - we believe you will enjoy having everything in one place! :) If you haven't received a Native Access serial number with one of the confirmation emails we are sending out, then the library you have purchased is to be treated as \"third party\" - we can't provide serial numbers for those and so the products aren't visible in the standard \"library view\" of Kontakt.

Perfect for Horror Scoring or any Audio Production which is in need of some breathtaking never before heard sounds. All the organic sounds within the library are produced by 8 different sculptures created by Bulgarian sculptor Martian Tabakov . We recorded those strange and charismatic sounds while “playing” on each of those sculptures with a number of different mallets, sticks, brushes and of course, bows. Afterwards we processed them and arranged the performances into production ready loops and musical sound effects, while treating each sound like an articulation you would find in one of our orchestral collections. Due to that ARCHITECTURE OF SOUND is still a playable virtual collection and not just a pile of oneshot samples. Built for the full version of Native Instrument's Kontakt ARCHITECTURE OF SOUND can be further tweaked and customized thanks to the brandnew UI, which is based on our X3M Percussion Engine. The ARCHITECTURE OF SOUND library consists of a single template patch with which you are able to build your own music soundscapes and effects. The playing range of the keyboard is split into two categories: Tonal and Atonal sounds. On the lowest two octaves of the keyboard (C0 and C1) you have 4 atonal zones, which can be used to load and play any of the percussive sounds within the library from the browser in the center of the GUI. Those 4 zones are functioning the same way any of our other X3M engine libraries do - any of the keys within a zone is cycling through the round robins of the selected instrument. After the mentioned 4 percussion zones, there are two more tonal zones, each with a range of 2 octaves: first tonal zone starting at C2, and the second one - at C4. On each of those you are able to choose, load and play any of the tonal instruments, divided into 7 different categories - Drones, Drones 2 (Sound design), Tonal Percs, Bells, Bends, Reverses, Loops. The content of the library was recorded in Sofia Session Studio A with 3 microphone positions - Close, Decca and Hall. For each of those, you have the option to Purge (the ON/OFF button), Solo or Mute. In addition, you can adjust the volume and the stereo width. OVERVIEW: 8 one of a kind accoustic musical sculptures played and recorded in an ambient hall Over 100 curated unique sounds split among different categories like Loops, Booms, Hits, Scrapes, Drones, Tonal Perc, Bells and Reversed Production ready content as well as organic and raw material 3 Microphone Positions (Close, Decca, Hall) Playable Patches with multiple Dynamic Layers and Round Robins Further processing made simple thanks to a brandnew custom built UI Map your own Template Patches using the X3M Percussion Browser and Mapping Features Complete list of articulations and instruments available in the manual.

Stevan Description Documents Requirements The new children choir reference library featuring two separately recorded children sections (girls & boys) with full divisi options, our revolutionary polyphonic true legato as well as the critically acclaimed Syllabuilder Engine in its most advanced state. Powered by Native Instruments' FREE Kontakt Player (Full Version not required) Requires free Native Instruments Kontakt Player Version 6.7.1+ or full Native Instruments Kontakt Version 6.7.1+ ~16GB free space (~8GB free space for the library and 8GB for the installation files) min. of 4GB RAM HOW TO INSTALL ARVA CHILDREN CHOIR Remembering James by Benny Oschmann Somewhere In Wonderland by Jean-Gabriel Raynaud Where The Wind Blows by Blakus Between Worlds by Matt C. Stevan Wonders And Terrors To Behold by Adam Hochstatter A Christmas Adventure by An?e Rozman Beautiful Memory by Alexander Kostov Arva Walkthrough Arva Engine Overview Arva Soloists Update AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD VIA NATIVE ACCESS Powered by Native Instruments' Kontakt Player v5.7.1 or higher About ÁRVA Being in development for more than 3 years the final chapter of Strezov Sampling's Next Generation Choir Series is at hand. Starting with WOTAN, the lowest and probably most powerful men choir ever sampled and FREYJA - the first sampled choir to focus on the beauty of the female voice, ÁRVA marks the first ever sampled children choir, which is more than just a bonus to the female and male sections. Including the revolutionary Syllabuilder Engine first introduced with WOTAN, True Polyphonic Legato as well as the brand new Agile Legato, which allows you to play polyphonic legato with every syllable inside the library, ÁRVA benefits from every little secret discovered in a 4 years long journey of producing the most playable and realistic sounding choir libraries ever made. But that's not it! What if we told you that ÁRVA consists of two choirs instead of one? You heard right. ÁRVA marks the first ever sampled children choir library to include boys and girls choirs recorded seperately and in divisi sections (sopranos, altos)! Revolutionary Legato One of the biggest trademarks of Árva is its unique legato scripting, combining polyphonic true legato sampling with our very own Syllabuilding approach. The Syllabuilder Agile Legato not only allows the user to play legato with every syllable availabe in the library, but also features intelligent voice leading enabling polyphonic writing within just one patch. In other words: Hold down a chord in the left, play a melody with your right hand and have it all connected with legato transitions. This powerful feature is controllable by the most common of all midi cc controllers, the sustain pedal. In addition to the Agile Legato Árva again also features polyphonic true legato patches (Ah, Mm, Ooh, Mm-Ah, Mm-Ooh, Mm-Ooh-Ah ) for every divisi section in the library, which gives you tons of flexibility when it comes to writing legato lines. Syllabuilder Engine 3.5 When it comes to virtual choirs there are basically two approaches: Phrasebuilding (StormChoir series) and Wordbuilding (Rhodope series). Árva combines the simplicity and sample recording of phrasebuilding with the advanced editing functions of wordbuilding. This allows you to have amazing sounding results within seconds, but also to build and create new sample content with only few mouse-clicks. Create complete choral patterns inside the GUI or connect different syllables and morph them to add motion to your choir arrangements. Save and Load complete lyric presets to quickly get yourself into the actual composition or enhance your setup with predefined quick words. All samples have their natural attacks included. However if you want to tighten them up the Syllabuilder Engine allows you to set custom attack, release, volume and offset values for each field independently. Something first introduced by WOTAN Male Choir and before that greatly missed in all phrasebuilding choir libraries. Version 3 now features compatibility among all of our choirs included in the Next Generation Choir Series meaning you can exchange lyrics and presets, thus saving an incredible amount of time. Overview: Separately recorded boys and girls choir ensembles True Divisi recordings for boys and girls sections Boys and Girls Soloists with Polyphonic True Legato and Agile Legato Polyphonic True Legato (Ah, Mm, Ooh, Mm-Ah, Mm-Ooh, Mm-Ooh-Ah) and Agile Legato (10 Syllables) for every divisi section of both ensembles 10 powerful syllables recorded within 2 dynamic layers + 1 \"faux\" dynamic layer to smooth out crossfading Sustain (1xRR) and Staccato (2xRR) samples 3 mic positions - Close, Decca, Hall + custom convolution reverb The powerful Syllabuilder engine 3.0 with CONNECT and MORPH modes that allow you to create your own sample content within Kontakt Ability to Load and Save your lyrics, built-in preset manager Fully compatible with Wotan and Freyja Integrated manual CHOIR Collection Choir Essentials Strezov Sampling has become my first choice for choir and percussion libraries which often play a big part in what I write.

Juno Reactor - Ben Watkins The Matrix Reloaded, Mortal Kombat As not all of our products come with unique serial numbers which you are to insert into Native Access, please pay close attention to the products' technical requirements sections - they can tell you if you can power a certain library through the free Kontakt Player, or if you need to purchase the retail version of Kontakt in order to use the library to its fullest potential (for instance - Architecture of Sound is meant only for the full Kontakt v5.7.1 or higher, while Storm Choir Ultimate can be powered through v5.7.1 or higher for both the full / paid Kontakt and the free Kontakt Player). Our libraries don't work in standalone mode without Native Instruments Kontakt, so you only need to pay attention to the required Kontakt / Kontakt Player version. If you can open Kontakt's respective version with your current OS, then you can be sure the library will work, as well. In the new version of our site, all our existing clients have profiles of their own, containing orders, download links for libraries and updates, personal / company information for invoicing, crossgrade options and gift cards. Try yours - we believe you will enjoy having everything in one place! :) If you haven't received a Native Access serial number with one of the confirmation emails we are sending out, then the library you have purchased is to be treated as \"third party\" - we can't provide serial numbers for those and so the products aren't visible in the standard \"library view\" of Kontakt.

              "content": "How to set up a library in Native Access? First off - congratulations on your new purchase and a big \"Thank you\" for trusting our brand. As a rule, libraries powered by NI's Kontakt Player need to be activated through Native Access. The following article is here to assist you in navigating this process. Prerequisites: I. You need to have the library downloaded and extracted as per our installation guides. Depending on your operating system of choice, here they are: https://www.strezov-sampling.com/learn/articles/step-by-steps/install-winpc https://www.strezov-sampling.com/learn/articles/step-by-steps/install-macos In essence, and regardless of our way of packaging the libraries' archives, the parent folder should look like this: Parent folder name = Strezov Sampling (library name) content / subfolders: - Instruments - Samples - Manual / Documentation - one .nicnt file standing on its own (in the root of the parent folder) NOTE: The above goes for all libraries with NKS compatibility / all libraries with Native Access serial numbers assigned to their copies. For the libraries with no serial numbers (considered by Kontakt as third-party), the folder structure / necessary content is as follows: Parent folder name = Strezov Sampling (library name) content / subfolders: - Instruments - Samples - Manual / Documentation - one .nkc and one .nkr file, standing on their own (in the root of the parent folder) II. You need to have Native Access installed on your workstation. III. Last, but not least - you need a functioning Native Instruments user account. Now that all this is out of the way, shall we begin? :) 1. After you log into Native Access successfully, please click on the \"Add a serial\" button in the upper left corner of the interface: 2. Like the page suggests, please insert the serial number you have for your library. In this article we'll be using AFFLATUS Chapter I Strings as an example. You can get your serial either from the email sent by admin@strezov-sampling.com , named \"New order on Strezov Sampling\", or through the \"My Products\" section of your user profile on our website. Here's what things will look like: 3. After you have typed in / pasted these symbols, click on \"add serial\" again, please. Here's a snapshot depicting the confirmation message being displayed upon your success: 4. After you are done with this part, please navigate either to the \"Available\" or to the \"All\" tab of Native Access' interface. AFFLATUS should be really easy to spot, at the top of the list. Once you've found it, please click on the \"Install\" button. If you have already downloaded and unpacked the library on your workstation, instead of starting an actual installation process, the application will just prompt you to point it to the actual location the library has been stored on. 5. Now that Native Access knows where to search for Afflatus' content (instruments, samples, etc.) you should be able to see it in the \"Installed\" tab, something similar to this: 6. And you are all set! I hope this article is of assistance to you and that our instruments serve you well! In case you run into any additional issues, don't hesitate to reach out to us at support@strezov-sampling.com . Goodbye for now!",

Comprised of ten altos and ten sopranos, all part of many choir recording sessions for artists like Two Steps from Hell, and recorded in the Sofia Session Studio FREYJA sets a new standard in choral sampling introducing the brandnew agile legato sampling technique allowing the user to seamlessly play polyphonic legato with every syllable in the library. Revolutionary Agile Legato Although there are many reasons FREYJA justifies to be called a next-gen library the biggest of them all is the brandnew Agile Legato. Uncountable hours of work went into creating this brandnew technique of combining true legato sampling with our Syllabuilding approach. Agile Legato not only allows the user to play legato with every syllable availabe in the library, but also features intelligent voice leading enabling polyphonic writing within just one patch. In other words: Hold down a chord in the left, play a melody with your right hand and have it all connected with legato transitions. This powerful feature is controllable by the most common of all midi cc controllers, the sustain pedal.

Something first introduced by WOTAN Male Choir and before that greatly missed in all phrasebuilding choir libraries. The Performance Patch - Amazing sounding results within seconds! By tradition our choral products excel at accessibility and getting great sounding choir lines within seconds. The Performance Patch allows you to perform your choir lines on the fly due to custom edits of the recordings to make them extremely playable, while maintaining their organic and raw tone. Our Velocity Dynamic Influencer allows you to determine the loudness of single chord notes by velocity, which makes highlighting certain notes within a chord easier than ever, while Modwheel CC1 still controls crossfading between the natural dynamic layers. The combination of both greatly enhances the expression you can get out of a regular keyboard performance. If you ever looked for a \"go-to\" choir patch. This is it!

David Buckley Jason Bourne, Batman: Arkham Knight, The Sandman Strezov's AFFLATUS BRASS is my new front-line weapon for orchestral brass. The Velocity Dynamics Influencer feature is immediately useful in my workflow, and the ability to switch instantly between sustain, mono-legato, and poly-legato is another massively useful feature. And the sound is all I could hope for, from delicate to brutal, from intimate to massive, from up close to miles away. Supreme realism, instant playability, and world-class tone. A massive thumbs up!

Focusing on one of the most iconic choir timbres of the last decades in the history of film soundtracks - The Khazad-dûm male choir - Wotan is the ultimate box of tools to evoke the sound of a long forgotten kingdom. Comprised of ten tenors and ten basses (including basso profundos), all part of many choir recording sessions for artists like Two Steps from Hell, and recorded in the Sofia Session Studio Wotan is the perfect addition to the critically acclaimed StormChoir range adding a whole new layer of dimension and detail. Syllabuilder Engine 3.5 When it comes to virtual choirs there are basically two approaches: Phrasebulding (StormChoir series) and Wordbuilding (Rhodope series). Wotan combines the simplicity and sample recording of phrasebuilding with the advanced editing functions of wordbuilding. This allows you to have amazing sounding results within seconds, but also to build and create new sample content with only few mouse-clicks. Create complete choral patterns inside the GUI or connect different syllables and morph them to add motion to your choir arrangements. Save and Load complete lyric presets to quickly get yourself into the actual composition or enhance your setup with predefined quick words. All samples have their natural attacks included. However if you want to tighten them up the Syllabuilder Engine allows you to set custom attack, release, volume and offset values for each field independently. Something completely new and greatly missed in all phrasebuilding choir libraries. Revolutionary Agile Legato Although there are many reasons WOTAN justifies to be called a next-gen library the biggest of them all is the brandnew Agile Legato. Uncountable hours of work went into creating this brandnew technique of combining true legato sampling with our Syllabuilding approach. Agile Legato not only allows the user to play legato with every syllable availabe in the library, but also features intelligent voice leading enabling polyphonic writing within just one patch. In other words: Hold down a chord in the left, play a melody with your right hand and have it all connected with legato transitions. This powerful feature is controllable by the most common of all midi cc controllers, the sustain pedal. In addition to the Agile Legato WOTAN also features polyphonic true legato patches (Ah, Mm and Oh) for both tenors and basses, which gives you tons of flexibility when it comes to writing legato lines. The Performance Patch - Amazing sounding results within seconds! By tradition our choral products excel at accessibility and getting great sounding choir lines within seconds. The Performance Patch allows you to perform your choir lines on the fly due to custom edits of the recordings to make them extremely playable, while maintaining their organic and raw tone. Our Velocity Dynamic Influencer allows you to determine the loudness of single chord notes by velocity, which makes highlighting certain notes within a chord easier than ever, while Modwheel CC1 still controls crossfading between the natural dynamic layers. The combination of both greatly enhances the expression you can get out of a regular keyboard performance. If you ever looked for a \"go-to\" choir patch. This is it! Overview: 10 GB compressed and optimized sample content Instant Lord of the Rings sound! Separate recordings of ten tenors and ten basses The lowest basses ever sampled (Kontra G) 8 Polyphonic True Legato Patches (Ah, Oh, Mhm and MhmOhAh) for Tenors and Basses 8 powerful syllables recorded within 3 dynamic layers Performance Patch included Sustain (1xRR) and Staccato (2xRR) samples 3 mic positions - Close, Decca, Hall + custom convolution reverb Whispers and Shouts with multiple RRs recorded for all syllables Bonus sample content - 3 types of clusters recorded for tenors and basses within 3 dynamic layers!

It's an aggressive instrument that really captures the sound of an epic male choir. Wotan also comes with a useful phrase builder and I'm especially impressed with the choir shouts and whispering recordings, which can also be controlled by the phrase builder! Amazing Stuff! Jesper Kyd Assassin's Creed Series, Borderlands Series, Hitman Series REALLY LOVE the choirs, we want these plastered everywhere and to have a huge influence on the other tracks! Peter Conelly Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Watch Dogs Strezov Sampling has become my first choice for choir and percussion libraries which often play a big part in what I write. Great quality and most importantly, highly playable . Can’t wait to see what they come up with next! Neal Acree World of Warcraft, Overwatch As not all of our products come with unique serial numbers which you are to insert into Native Access, please pay close attention to the products' technical requirements sections - they can tell you if you can power a certain library through the free Kontakt Player, or if you need to purchase the retail version of Kontakt in order to use the library to its fullest potential (for instance - Architecture of Sound is meant only for the full Kontakt v5.7.1 or higher, while Storm Choir Ultimate can be powered through v5.7.1 or higher for both the full / paid Kontakt and the free Kontakt Player). Our libraries don't work in standalone mode without Native Instruments Kontakt, so you only need to pay attention to the required Kontakt / Kontakt Player version. If you can open Kontakt's respective version with your current OS, then you can be sure the library will work, as well. In the new version of our site, all our existing clients have profiles of their own, containing orders, download links for libraries and updates, personal / company information for invoicing, crossgrade options and gift cards. Try yours - we believe you will enjoy having everything in one place! :) If you haven't received a Native Access serial number with one of the confirmation emails we are sending out, then the library you have purchased is to be treated as \"third party\" - we can't provide serial numbers for those and so the products aren't visible in the standard \"library view\" of Kontakt. We can still offer you a workaround for the Strezov Sampling libraries you are using. Still have a questions?

We were hugely inspired by the typical orthodox liturgy sound and especially all the hymns written by composers like Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Strumski, Arhangelski and many other. For this library we recorded 12 men - 6 basses and 6 tenors in an authentic orthodox church! They are recorded separately, into two groups. The library is chromatically sampled and all the samples were run through Avalon AD2044F just for that warm analogue sound. The library consists of three dynamics – piano, mezzo piano and forte – using the vowel “Ooh” (with the exception of f dynamic which was sung in “Aah”). The library has four mic positions – close (mixdown of 6-mic array really close to the singers), decca (Decca tree LCR above the conductor), side (two mics LR in the courners of the hall) and back (two mics behind the singers, facing the wall and thus a reflected pre-delay sound). The Remastered Edition brings a new UI based on our recent Afflatus Series releases as well as polyphonic true legato as a free update. It is also encoded for Native Instrument's Kontakt Player and NKS compatible. PATCH List: Tropar Basses Tropar Tenors Tropar Mixed Range: (C3=middle C) Basses: G0 - F2 Tenors: B1-G3 Mixed: G0-G3 Three dynamic layers, two vowels and polyphonic true legato p - with vowel \"Ooh\" mf - with vowel \"Ooh\" f - with vowel \"Ah\" The Remastered Edition is free for existing users of Tropar. A re-download is required. As not all of our products come with unique serial numbers which you are to insert into Native Access, please pay close attention to the products' technical requirements sections - they can tell you if you can power a certain library through the free Kontakt Player, or if you need to purchase the retail version of Kontakt in order to use the library to its fullest potential (for instance - Architecture of Sound is meant only for the full Kontakt v5.7.1 or higher, while Storm Choir Ultimate can be powered through v5.7.1 or higher for both the full / paid Kontakt and the free Kontakt Player). Our libraries don't work in standalone mode without Native Instruments Kontakt, so you only need to pay attention to the required Kontakt / Kontakt Player version. If you can open Kontakt's respective version with your current OS, then you can be sure the library will work, as well. In the new version of our site, all our existing clients have profiles of their own, containing orders, download links for libraries and updates, personal / company information for invoicing, crossgrade options and gift cards. Try yours - we believe you will enjoy having everything in one place! :) If you haven't received a Native Access serial number with one of the confirmation emails we are sending out, then the library you have purchased is to be treated as \"third party\" - we can't provide serial numbers for those and so the products aren't visible in the standard \"library view\" of Kontakt. We can still offer you a workaround for the Strezov Sampling libraries you are using. Still have a questions?

Author: Kevin Kuschel Reading time: 18 mins In this chapter, we'll cover the basics of getting started with composing in a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) from the perspective of an orchestral composer. Table of Contents What is a DAW? Which DAW should I choose? First steps in your DAW Start writing music MIDI editing Project organization Mixing and mastering Learn your DAW What is a DAW? A Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) is a type of software that allows you to record, edit and mix music . Composers use DAWs to create musical compositions using virtual instruments and MIDI controllers. With orchestral sample libraries, this usually happens in the MIDI file format . Knowing the ins and outs of your DAW is one of the best ways to compose faster and better. Learn your DAW! DAWs are used by professional and amateur musicians alike. DAWs have come a long way since they were first introduced in the 1980s. Modern workstations can do anything from recording live instruments to producing professional-sounding songs with ease. The best part about using a DAW is that it gives you total control over every aspect of your music production process. You can record audio, add effects, and mix multiple tracks within one application! The most common DAWs for writing orchestral music are Cubase , Logic Pro (Mac only), Studio One , and Reaper . Tip: A DAW doesn't produce music by itself. It's your work environment . Your DAW is like a canvas: A space for you to use your tools on and create a composition. Which DAW should I choose? Beginners often wonder what's the best DAW for them. The short answer is: That depends on the type of music you're making. Different DAWs are better suited to different kinds of music. Some of most popular Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs): Cubase, Logic Pro, Reaper, Studio One, FL Studio, Ableton Live and Pro Tools. If you're an electronic music producer, you might want to try Ableton Live or Logic Pro X . If you're a hip-hop producer, then FL Studio might be the best option for you. It's safe to say that Cubase is the most used DAW by professionals , and it's often considered the best DAW for orchestral music . Hans Zimmer has been using Cubase for decades . Personally, I use Studio One for its straightforward interface, simple drag-and-drop workflow and a lot of Cubase-like functionality for orchestral music. You must find the DAW that fits your workflow . You need to be able to create music quickly and efficiently without getting distracted by features you don't really need. This was my main reason for choosing Studio One over Cubase. But that may change. For each of the DAWs listed above, I know of at least 1 professional composer who creates orchestral music with it. The main thing to remember is that there is no best DAW . Composers argue about this daily. Some people will say that one type of software is better, but that's only true in how it benefits them personally . I think they'd better use the time to write awe-inspiring music rather than debating all day. DAWs are a lot like operating systems, with some DAWs being better for certain types of music than others. It all depends on the task you want to achieve. Most DAWs do the same thing; they just do it in different ways, and the best DAW is the one you're most comfortable using. Your music sounds the same in every DAW. But some have better workflows for orchestral music than others. You should also consider how much money you want to spend on software and how long it will take you to learn how to use it. Have an eye on sales to buy your DAW of choice at a discounted price. Most DAWs come with free trial versions, so do your research, ask around and most importantly: Try them out yourself! Not sure which DAW is best for you? Let the Become A Pro Composer community help you out! How to use a DAW Let's dive into the basic steps of how to use a DAW. Each DAW comes with a comprehensive manual you should refer to when stuck. But let's be honest. Those manuals are often huge and daunting, with tons of information crammed into one PDF. Cubase Pro 12’s manual has 1391 pages ! That's why I'll now explain the essential workflows of how you will use your DAW to create orchestral music step by step. In simple words! We'll focus on the basics that all DAWs share. No matter which DAW you choose to try, the following paragraphs help you understand the general concepts of how orchestral composing works on a computer. I'll use Studio One as an example for the screenshots. Select your audio interface in the driver settings Making sure you hear things is the first step you should take with any DAW on the first startup. Your speakers or headphones need to be connected to your audio interface, which is connected to your computer. To hear it, select the correct audio device . Usually, you'll want to choose the driver with the name of your audio interface (e.g. Focusrite USB in my case). Audio Device settings in Studio One: I've selected \"Focusrite USB\" as audio device. Tip: Double-check the Audio Device settings if you don't have sound in your DAW. Does the driver name correspond to your audio interface? Connect any MIDI controller or external devices in the hardware section You have to make sure your DAW correctly detects your MIDI controllers . Some MIDI keyboards come with installable drivers that help the DAW recognize them. Others you have to add yourself to the DAW settings. Usually, these settings are called External devices or MIDI Devices . The website or manual of your MIDI controller manufacturer should explain how to set up your MIDI controller for each DAW ( example ). External Devices settings in Studio One: I set up the MIDI keyboard and its transport buttons. Check your MIDI controller manual (and DAW manual!) for help with the setup. Start writing music It's finally here: The moment where we create our own music. Create a new project , give it a name and choose tempo and time signature . You can change these values later on. You're now seeing your main work environment. All of your music will be created here, so you better get familiar with the sight. Here are some of the essential steps you’ll do every time when writing music. Adding tracks The first thing you'll do in every project is add tracks . A track holds the musical information, and usually, you'll use one instrument per track. One track may have the violins, another the violas. One more track for the cello and one for the basses. Et voilá. You got yourself a placeholder for a virtual strings section. I created 5 tracks for my strings section: Violins 1, violins 2, violas, cellos and basses. Tracks are the fundamental building blocks of a digital audio workstation. A track contains all the information about the audio or MIDI you recorded, including volume levels, panning, effects settings, and automation data. A track is usually a single recording with its own channel in a DAW. It contains all the information about the audio or MIDI you recorded, including volume levels, left-and-right panning, effects, and how these parameters behave over time (automation). Example: If you wanted to record an acoustic guitar and a vocal track together, then you would need two separate tracks - one for each instrument. This way, you can, for example, control the volume of the vocals and the processing effects of the guitar separately. MIDI tracks vs. Audio tracks Most of the time, you'll work with MIDI tracks , also called Instrument tracks . MIDI is like sheet music for virtual instruments. It contains the information on the notes you input, including data such as how hard you pressed it or for how long (see MIDI Editing below). It does not make any sound alone and does not include any information about the instrument. Therefore, MIDI tracks need a virtual instrument (VST) or sample library loaded. The instrument will then play back the MIDI instructions as you compose them. You can take the same MIDI information and play it with a trumpet, violin, or contrabassoon! The massive benefit of MIDI is that it's highly editable. You can change each note's parameters like note length or the intensity it's played with. MIDI notes of an Instrument track. In the MIDI editor, you can drag, duplicate and edit each of the notes with one click. Audio tracks, on the other hand, contain rendered audio clips. They do make a sound. If you drag and drop an .mp3 or .wav file of a song into your DAW, it creates an audio track and shows you its waveform. Waveform of an audio track. The information is baked into the audio file and you can not edit individual notes, only the audio as a whole. There are also many ways to edit audio. Still, it's less flexible than MIDI editing because you don't have access to the individual note as they are baked into the audio file. PS: Don't confuse the name track in your DAW with the tracks used colloquially when talking about a song (\"What a nice track !\"). Load sample libraries For each MIDI track, you must load the virtual instrument you want to use. In orchestral music production, that's usually sample libraries . Sample libraries need a sampler to function. Most orchestral libraries run on Kontakt (either the full version or the free Kontakt Player). So, after adding a track, you load a Kontakt instance (in Studio One simply drag Kontakt from the browser onto the track) and then choose your sample library . I dragged an instance of Kontakt to one of my instrument tracks and loaded the free sample library Heavyocity Foundations Staccato Brass. The same goes for SINE Player , Spitfire Audio Player , or other samplers. Now you should see your sample library's interface and be able to play it. Instruments that don't need a sampler can immediately be dragged into a track. These are usually referred to as VSTs. The separation is not 100% clear, as sample libraries are usually considered VSTs (but not vice versa). Don't worry about the naming. Everyone will understand you either way. Record your melody There are two popular ways of adding notes to your track. Both are used by professional composers, and there is no right or wrong. Pick the workflow that works best for you. Program with mouse and keyboard . You can add notes in most DAWs by double-clicking in the MIDI editor. On the left, you'll see the piano roll. It shows which line in the MIDI editor corresponds to which note. You can drag the note ends to change their length and move them around by dragging them in the center. With your mouse, you can copy-paste notes and draw in all the MIDI editing like velocities and dynamics (see below). One benefit is having enough time to think about every note without being rushed by a metronome. Record with your MIDI controller. This method comes closer to a live performance. You press the record button and play the melody on your MIDI controller. Activating the metronome helps with timing accuracy. The main benefit is that you can add a human feel to your lines as you play them. Experienced composers can simultaneously play the notes and add dynamics with the mod wheel (see below), which helps them save time. But it may require several takes to get it right. Sometimes it's easier to quickly add a few notes with the mouse and adjust them to taste. I use both depending on the style and length of the melody. My favorite way to record is the step record which combines both methods: You play in notes with your MIDI controller. With each pressed note, the MIDI editor goes one position further. Combine this with keyboard shortcuts to change note lengths or use a Stream Deck for some serious workflow magic . You'll enjoy the best of both worlds. Try both ways of recording and go with what makes you create better results in a shorter amount of time. MIDI editing After programming notes with your mouse and keyboard or recording them with a MIDI controller, you'll have to edit them. These are the most common types of MIDI values you'll adjust when composing orchestral music. Timing It's near impossible to record a longer line perfectly in time. You may have input lag in busy projects due to saving CPU power with larger buffer size. Your sample libraries might come with a built-in delay (explained below), and you may not be used to recording with a MIDI controller. Especially at the beginning of your composer journey, your recorded melodies need a lot of tweaking. You can move notes back and forth individually or select multiple at once to improve their timings and make them sound on beat. Activate the in-built metronome of your DAW to ensure everything sounds tight and on time. Changing each note manually results in a lot of work. That's why you can also do it the quick way by quantizing . Quantize automatically nudges your notes to the grid to make them sound in sync with the beat. CAREFUL: Quantizing everything to the grid can make your song sound robotic and unnatural, especially when quantizing percussion. There are two things you can do to counter overquantizing: Most DAWs support partial quantization , where you can set a percentage value. It will nudge the notes towards the grid, but only a bit (I like to use 50-75% values). Quantize everything to the grid, then use the humanize or randomize feature to add minor timing inconsistencies to the performance (I like to use ±15ms). As a rule of thumb, your MIDI notes should be tight but not perfectly in time. The musicians in the orchestra aren't, either. Velocities Velocity is represented by how hard you press a note on your MIDI controller. It usually affects the intensity of a note . A low-velocity bass drum may sound soft and smooth. Yet, with increasing velocity, it can turn into a thundering boom. Editing the velocities is particularly important for setting accentuation in your melodies or rhythm lines. Those notes you want to emphasize need a higher velocity than decorative notes in-between. Like timings, you can also humanize or randomize velocities with most DAWs or use a pen tool to draw patterns. Dynamics In orchestral music, dynamics are huge and mainly responsible for an instrument's expressiveness. When playing melodies, musicians adapt to the phrasing. They \"feel \"the melody. They might get quieter before adding little swells to make the music come to life. Whereas velocity usually controls the initial force of the beginning of a note (the \"attack \"), dynamics are responsible for the intensity throughout notes that are held for a longer time . Dynamics are usually controlled via the mod wheel. Every note would have the same feel if a melody with no dynamics were added. You can add detail and life to the melody line by moving your mod wheel up and down or drawing dynamics patterns with your mouse. Your music is now performed rather than just playing back. Set negative track delay Most orchestral sample libraries have some sort of delay. This is not a bug or a shortcoming of your library! Instead, it's intended to achieve a more realistic sound: Imagine you play a violin and want to perform a nice and smooth melody. You press your finger on a string and use the bow to play the note. For the following note, you need to change your finger position. Either by gliding up or down the same string or by lifting your finger and pressing on another string. Then you bow those notes. This example shows that two notes never just happen . There is always context between them, some sort of transition. These little slides and scratches are vital for a detailed, convincing sound, even if you haven't consciously noticed them before when listening to orchestral music. High-quality orchestral sample libraries add these transitions in the so-called legato articulation of the library. So, when playing a melody with two notes on your keyboard, the sample library automatically adds a short bridge between them, causing the second note to sound slightly delayed. Your DAW can compensate for this delay by playing every note on your track a bit earlier. This is called negative track delay , or delay compensation. Check the manual of your library to find out its sample delay. Example : The sample delay of Cinematic Studio Strings' short notes is ca. 60ms . The library will sound slightly delayed if you play a melody perfectly in time. It may not be a big deal, but having these little timing inconsistencies throughout an entire orchestral track makes it sound undefined and washy in total. Set your track to -60ms to fix this. It will now be in time. I set the track delay for the Violins 2 track to -60ms, because Cinematic Studio Strings has 60ms delay on short notes Some orchestral libraries - like those from Audio Imperia - have adjustable sample delays : When recording your melodies, you can set them to 0ms for maximum responsiveness with no audible delay. See the center bottom knob \"S. Start\" on the right. It's set all the way to the right. Once you've finished recording, set the library to 250ms sample delay for maximum realism and compensate it with a -250ms negative track delay in your DAW. You'll now have it play those realistic legato transitions in time . By now, you've experimented with adding a track, recording a melody, working on the MIDI editing, and compensating sample delay. But a composition rarely consists of one instrument only, especially not in orchestral music. Depending on your workflow, orchestral tracks often range from somewhere between 15 and 150 tracks! So, add more tracks to your project and record more melodies, bass lines, and harmonies. Project organization As you expand your track count, you'll soon notice a need for organization . Things get chaotic fast. Name your tracks Seriously! Initially, it may seem like a hassle, but it's a time-saver later. A messy project is the killer of progress and creativity, as you'll waste lots of time trying to find your instruments. Add the name of every instrument and perhaps the sample library abbreviation to each track. Example: Violin 1 CSS, Violin 2 CSS, Trumpet 1 CSB, Horns CSB + FS, … Use folders Summarizing instrument groups like the orchestral sections into one folder helps with overall project visibility. It opens up a few handy collective editing options. Select the violins, violas, cellos, and basses, right-click, and you'll see an option to place them in a folder. This should work for all common DAWs. Name the folder STRINGS . You can now mute and solo, show and hide all of your string instruments with one click. This keeps your project tidy, and you can focus on the section you're currently working on. Organizing sections into folders also opens up the possibility of creating macros that will - for example - hide all instruments except for those in the strings folder. Or only the orchestral instruments but none of the synths and sound design. You get the point! Violins, violas, cellos and basses are in a folder \"Cinematic Studio Strings\", which is in a folder \"Strings\". If you want to use a second strings library, e.g. Pacific Strings, you can place its instrument tracks into a folder \"Pacific Strings\" and add it to the Strings folder. Mixing and mastering After creating several music tracks, tweaking them in the MIDI editor, and organizing your project with track names and folders, you'll have to improve the sound quality . That's what mixing is for. You'll balance track volumes , pan instruments left and right to fill the space, and add effects to shape and improve the sound with external plugins. This usually happens in your DAWs mixer , a virtual presentation of those massive mixing consoles you've seen in music production studios. With its many faders and clunky design, the mixer often looks like a place you want to get out of as fast as possible. But it's actually quite simple. Move faders for the volume, a slider for left and right panning, and effects slots for adding external plugins. We'll go into this more in-depth in the mixing chapter. Mastering is the second step in improving the overall sound quality of your piece as a whole. This time, changes are not made separately for each instrument but very broadly on the master channel . This is the channel that controls the parameters of all your instruments at the same time. Mastering is also super helpful to ensure multiple tracks of an album have similar overall sound quality. It helps control the overall volume of your composition to ensure it's loud enough and further tweaks the overall soundscape by adding things like compression and equalization. But more on that later. Learn your DAW By now, you should have understood the general concepts of DAWs and how we will write orchestral music using MIDI tracks and sample libraries. But the process has many details that differ from DAW to DAW. I can't cover these here. But at least I want to give you some tips on how you can learn your DAW efficiently. Let's face it: Learning a DAW can be hard . There are so many settings, options, and jargon that it's easy to get lost. Especially in the beginning, the learning curve can initially seem pretty steep—like you're trying to climb Mount Everest in flip-flops. But there's good news! Just like any other skill, learning how to use your DAW can be learned with practice and perseverance. Here are 6 tips that help you learn your DAW of choice: Find a YouTube tutorial series for the DAW you're interested in. These are a great way to get started because you can watch at your own pace and focus on the parts that interest you most. Take the time to learn the basics, and don't rush through the tutorials. Here are some helpful tutorial playlists for Studio One , Cubase , Logic Pro and Reaper . Read the manual on things you have specific questions about. Then read the entire chapter related to that question. It'll give you a solid foundation of knowledge and understanding when using the DAW in your project. Take notes as you go. These notes will help you remember what you've learned and help you retain the information longer. Take some time to explore the interface. Look at what each tool does and see if there's anything that catches your eye. Ask yourself: What is this tool used for? Can I see myself using this tool regularly? Do I understand how it works? Ask questions when you need help . The composer community will help you out for sure. Just don't be shy to ask! For more personalized training, consider getting a mentor. Many people out there love sharing their knowledge about DAWs and music production in general. Start with small projects! It's easier to learn on something small than something huge, so try doing some smaller projects while learning how everything works together in your DAW. Practice makes perfect. The more often you use a piece of software or program, the better you'll get at using it, so make sure to set aside some time every day or week for practicing your skills and honing your craft. In conclusion, it takes time to learn how to use these DAWs. Be patient with yourself, especially when just starting out. Don't get frustrated if you feel like you're not making any progress for a while. You'll get there eventually; the more you practice, the better you'll become at using your DAW. You'll optimize your workflows, use hotkeys and macros, and improve how you write music inside your digital working environment. You got this!

That's how I'd describe the libraries that I use regularly from Audio Imperia.\" Rupert Gregson-Williams Wonder Woman, The Crown, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom \"I love all Audio Imperia’s libraries - I use them on every single track and project. I always know that I’ll be able to find exactly what I’m looking for - especially with sound design elements - in at least one of their libraries. They take no shortcuts and every single sound is of the highest quality. I look forward to seeing what’s next as I can’t wait to use them more on future music!\" James Everingham Composer: Extreme Music \"My sonic palette is everything to me. I am constantly on the lookout for new tools and sounds to inspire me and enhance my compositions, adding that extra touch of energy or magic. I try always to push the boundaries of my production, striving to unleash my creativity with these tools. Audio Imperia has truly become an integral part of my composition process, so I cannot recommend their products enough.\" Ivan Torrent Award winning Composer \"Chorus has taken the primary choir position in my template. Beautifully recorded and programmed with amazing consistency. From incredibly emotional slow syllables, to roaring loud dynamics, this library really does cover it all.\" Blake Robinson aka Blakus Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, The Hobbit: Battle of The Five Armies, Mary Poppins Returns \"I use a lot of Audio Imperia libraries in my scoring work, from classics like Photosynthesis and Trailer Guitars through Jaeger, Constrictor, and the Flourish series, and they’re all innovative, evocative, and very hi-fi. The processed brass textures in Talos and massive percussion in Cerberus are great for conjuring up the sounds of desperation and panic, which is right up my alley. Highly recommended!\" Charlie Clouser Composer of the SAW franchise, Wayward Pines, Childhood's End “Chorus is a new staple in my writing template. The library provides me with a large collection of versatile and beautifully captured virtual choir sounds. I love that I have all of the traditional articulations used in orchestral scoring as well as the newly added Chorus FX. The large selection of microphone positions is great and very helpful for sculpting the sound of the library across various genres and projects. One choir library with so much variation and sonic integrity is hard to come by. \" Germaine Franco Composer and Orchestrator: Kung Fu Panda 3, Encanto, The Mother \"I’ve had Audio Imperia libraries in my template since their day 1, and the FVDE MIDI Controller lives under my left hand. Audio Imperia puts out innovative products at a good price! What more could you want!?!\" Michael Nielsen Owner/Composer at Ninja Tracks “Up until this point, if you wanted both (soft and loud choir) in your track you had to use two different libraries. [...] Now Chorus has completely solved that issue by allowing you to have the option to have either. And it even takes it one step further [...]. At the end of the day, what is important, is that the bar has been raised for choir libraries in my honest opinion. I think it's worth every penny, it's my go-to, it sounds great, and it plays great.” Daniel James Metal Gear Solid V, Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War, Terminator Genisys \"Once in a while, you get to find these beautiful gems and they quickly permeate your music and become a fixed staple in your writing template! This is precisely the case with Audio Imperia. I’m already looking forward to whatever new instruments they’ve got up their sleeves!\" Pieter Schlosser Composer of You, Me And The End Of The World, The Lying Game, Nightwatch, Gears of War, Transformers, The Sims \"Audio Imperia’s sample libraries have been a staple in my work for many years now. Their sounds are not only organic and interesting, but more importantly, are super musical and sit beautifully in the context of a piece. The sound library landscape is saturated with choices but Audio Imperia continues to be a company you can rely on for new inspiration. Their FVDE MIDI controller has no equal and has quickly become an invaluable asset in my studio.\" Kaveh Cohen Forza Motorsport, League of Legends, Splinter Cell Blacklist and Conviction \"I’ve been using Audio Imperia since it’s genesis. I think because they’re made of up of talented working composers/musicians, the guys at Audio Imperia understand exactly how the sounds and instruments are supposed to function in modern cutting-edge compositions. Every release is a high-caliber guarantee that I’ll get plenty of mileage out of. Their orchestral libraries are so functional and sound amazing out of the box, they always save me tons of time on mixing when I’m working fast on deadlines.\" Danny Cocke Star Trek Into Darkness, Thor: The Dark World, Oblivion \"I’ve spent countless hours in the past getting things to sound epic and massive. Now that I have Audio Imperia in my arsenal, I spend more time creating and less time tweaking. Ideas come together faster as the grunt work has already been done by Audio Imperia. It’s almost like someone has given me a cheat code for that cinematic sound and now that I have it, the Audio Imperia libraries are never leaving my arsenal.\" Anthony Baldino Sound Design on Tenet, Wakanda Forever, Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts \"The Audio Imperia tool kits are just what you need when you don't feel like searching and editing for hours for that \"one\" sound. Everything is clear, concise, high quality, and very unique; not to mention extremely useful and fun. They've quickly become one of my trusted go-to's for quick inspiration to build a cue around, or when I just need that \"something extra\" to add to the sonic space.\" Mark Yaeger Composer of Halo: Nightfall, Queen of the Desert, Disney's Lanfeust Quest \"The Audio Imperia cinematic tool kits are a bag of sonic tricks that I find myself using more and more. A great collection of pads and hard hitting dynamic sounds that I can't find anywhere else. Klavier Gravitas Piano and Red Planet Piano are absolutely gorgeous. Very strong and intimate but also powerful with deep rich ambiences and luscious trails. A classic, natural sounding piano with fantastic effects and a very clean and easy interface. Thanks Audio Imperia for such a beautiful instrument.\" Rod Abernethy Composer of Tome, Rage, Tera, Star Trek, The Hobbit & Dead Space \"Audio Imperia have created incredible detail and nuance in every one of their sounds. Whether you are using them straight of the box, or as ammunition for further warping and experimenting... you need these sounds in your arsenal! I'm excited to hear what they come up with next.\" Daniel Suett Composer, Bleeding Fingers Music \"I don't know how they managed to do it, but the Audio Imperia team has created new sound collections that are original, warm, organic and sit well inside many different types of tracks. About once a year - at best - I stumble across collections like these, which are exceptionally inspirational and useful. Trailer Guitars and the entire Photosynthesis collection have been essential parts of my Fall TV shows. Keep it up!\" Ben Decter Emmy Award Winning Film and TV Composer \"I'm a big fan of Audio Imperia! Modern composers are being overflown with new sample libraries everyday and very often I have noticed that the quantity takes over the quality. Not so in case of Audio Imperia. Even though they are relatively new on the market, they set their bar high which is to our direct benefit.

These Terms of Service reflect the way Google’s business works , the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true . As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings: What you can expect from us , which describes how we provide and develop our services What we expect from you , which establishes certain rules for using our services Content in Google services , which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others In case of problems or disagreements , which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms Understanding these terms is important because, by accessing or using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

Contents Introduction Your relationship with Google Using Google services Content in Google services Software in Google services In case of problems or disagreements About these terms Your relationship with Google These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its affiliates . Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s business works and how we earn money . What you can expect from us Provide a broad range of useful services We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including: apps and sites (like Search and Maps) platforms (like Google Shopping) integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites) devices (like Google Nest and Pixel) Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with. Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there. Develop, improve, and update Google services We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.

If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse . If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section. Don’t abuse our services Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse.

If we don’t meet the quality level described in this warranty , you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue. Disclaimers The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the Warranty section; (2) the service-specific additional terms ; and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms. Don’t rely on the services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional. Liabilities For all users Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible for certain liabilities — but not others — under these terms. These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for: fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation death or personal injury caused by negligence gross negligence willful misconduct Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms , subject to applicable law.

This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct. If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification , then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities. Google won’t be responsible for the following liabilities : loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings indirect or consequential loss punitive damages Except as stated in the For all users section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach. Taking action in case of problems Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would: cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order compromise an investigation compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services Removing your content If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies , (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights . Suspending or terminating your access to Google services Without limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen: you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page . If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal . Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services. Settling disputes, governing law, and courts For information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page . California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms , or any related services , regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence. About these terms By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights. These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations , even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms. We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services . But not all services mentioned may be available in your country. If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms , the additional terms will govern for that service. If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms , and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future. We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms , we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device.

The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using.

Why Google collects data We use data to build better services We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes: Provide our services We use your information to deliver our services , like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts. Maintain & improve our services We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended , such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results . For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like. Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center . We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories , such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos. We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop. Go to My Ad Center Measure performance We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns . We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services. Communicate with you We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing. Protect Google, our users, and the public We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public . We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate. We may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google. If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example. We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies. If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Keeping your information secure We build security into our services to protect your information All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information.

Information about things near your device If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more legal process, or enforceable governmental request Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report . make improvements For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone. may link information Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

Learn more payment information For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this. We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.

If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more phone number If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more Places you label like home and work You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for ads. You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account. protect against abuse For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account). publicly accessible sources For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services. For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more safety and reliability Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include: Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn more sensitive categories When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services. Sensor data from your device Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about how we use location information. servers around the world For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users. services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages Examples of these services include: Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls Gmail, for sending and receiving emails Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages Google Fi, for a phone plan show trends When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more similar information related to your physical or mental health If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken. specific Google services For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store. specific partners For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information. synced with your Google Account Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn more the people who matter most to you online For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently . the public For example, we process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices. third parties For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you. U.S. state privacy laws These laws include: California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA); Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA); Colorado Privacy Act (CPA); Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring (CTDPA); and Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) Washington My Health My Data Act (MHDM) Nevada Senate Bill 370 Florida Digital Bill of Rights (FDBR) Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA) Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA) Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA) New Jersey Senate Bill 332 New Hampshire Senate Bill 255 Nebraska Data Privacy Act (NEDPA) Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act (IACDPA) Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA) Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA) Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act (MNCDPA) Maryland Online Data Privacy Act of 2024 (MDODPA) use the information we collect across our services Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include: When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. Learn more If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. Learn more The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity. If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn more If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services. Views and interactions with content and ads For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears. Voice and audio information For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more your activity on other sites and apps This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Author: Kevin Kuschel Reading time: 22 mins Let's get you started with the basics of music theory - in under 30 minutes! The chapter is a condensed crash-course and suitable for low to upper beginners . We’re following the 80% rule: Focus on quick wins and don't bother with exceptions for now. Table of Contents What is pitch in music? Notes Rhythm Note intervals Melody Scales Modes Chords Understanding the fundamentals of music enables you to make conscious decisions when composing. It helps you make your music sound as you want it to, rather than being an unfortunate series of harmonic accidents. A little music theory can go a long way. Huzzah! Enroll in Orchestral Music Production For Beginners to learn how to compose orchestral music 2-3x faster and with confidence. What is pitch in music? When you hear musical tones, they sound high or low to you. This is called pitch . Pitch is determined by the sound wave frequency, measured in hertz (Hz) units. 1 Hz = 1 vibration per second. A higher frequency produces a higher pitch and vice versa. Spectrum of frequencies audible by animals and humans. As you can see from the image, orchestral music happens somewhere between 16 Hz and 20,000 Hz, so it can be heard. Unless you compose for elephants, of course :) The frequency of the middle C, for example, is around 261.63 Hz. It vibrates 261.63 times per second. C4 note (ca. 261Hz): Your browser does not support the audio element. Notes Notes are the smallest unit of music. If you're building a house, you'll need bricks (at least in Europe…). You stack and arrange them to form a bigger whole. That's what you do with musical notes, too! A note is a pitch (high or low) that sounds for a specific time (note length). Note = pitch + duration We've learned that notes would be written down in Hz (pitch) and seconds (duration). But that would look a bit scientific, and we don't want to use decimals numbers with comma values for writing music… That's why music simplified things. Note names Pitches with specific frequencies are given note names. Examples: Frequency [Hz] Note name 261.63 C4 293.66 D4 329.63 E4 349.23 F4 392.00 G4 440.00 A4 493.88 B4 523.25 C5 Much easier to say, \"Let's play a C, then follow up with an A,\" instead of \"Let's play a 261.63 Hz, then 440 Hz\". Notice that notes with double the frequency have the same note name but with a higher number. C6 is double the pitch of C5. C4 is half the pitch of C5. C4, C5 and C6 notes: Your browser does not support the audio element. It's the same note but a so-called octave higher. The name octave comes from the Latin word octo for the number eight. There are 8 note steps from C4 to C5 (see table). Note duration The duration of a note is also simplified into note lengths . Let's take a C4 pitch and give it a duration. For example, 2 seconds. This is our full, whole note . Half of that note would be 1 second. Two half notes have the same duration as a full note. A quarter of the note 0.5 seconds. Two quarter notes have the same duration as a half note. And that's precisely how music uses notes. You define the duration of a \"full note\" and then work with its relatives (half, quarter, etc.). With this, we can build patterns. The human brain loves patterns. Much easier to say, \"Let's play a quarter note, then follow up with two eight notes,\" instead of \"Let's play the first note for 1.25 seconds, then follow up with two notes of 0.625 seconds\". Because of this organization, there are different types of musical notes. Illustration inspired by https://www.musictheoryacademy.com/how-to-read-sheet-music/note-lengths/ Notes can last for different amounts of time depending upon their type; for example, quarter notes have four beats per bar, whereas eighth notes have twice as many beats per bar. The duration of a standard note varies from song to song. This is called tempo and usually represents the duration of a quarter note. A piece with a quarter note duration of 1s has a tempo of 60 beats per minute. A quarter note duration of 0.5s corresponds to a tempo of 120 beats per minute. A song tempo is defined as beats per minute (bpm) . You can choose it freely. Rhythm You create rhythm by attaching different note lengths to create a pattern of sound in time. Simply spoken. This is an example of a rhythmic pattern. It can be clapped with your hands and doesn't require an instrument. Simple rhythm pattern, tempo 110: Your browser does not support the audio element. You might already figure out that the sequence you hear uses 2 longer notes, 2 shorter notes with twice the speed, followed by one last note. Two quarter notes, two eighth notes, and one last quarter note. The final note could also be a half or even a whole note. A higher tempo makes the pattern sound faster but doesn't change the sequence itself. The same rhythm pattern but at tempo 140: Your browser does not support the audio element. The time signature tells you how many beats are in each bar. I said that a whole note lasts 4 quarter notes and fills one bar. This means that 4 quarter notes also fill a bar. The time signature is 4/4 (speak: four quarters). There are other time signatures, for example, 3/4. Here, 1 bar is already filled by 3 quarter notes. Rhythm patterns can be expanded by pronouncing some notes more than others, adding small pauses, and using more complex note lengths like triplets or dotted notes. We'll keep it simple here. Let's now assign the rhythm to an instrument: Your browser does not support the audio element. That's because we use the same note (= same pitch). Let's change up the notes, but keep the rhythm. Much more interesting: Your browser does not support the audio element. But how did I know which notes to select, so it sounds good and not like a chaotic mess? Because I knew which intervals to choose. Note Intervals A note interval is the distance between two notes. You can understand note intervals with a piano keyboard. The smallest interval in music is called a half step , or semitone. On the piano, each neighboring key is precisely one half step above or below. The next interval is called a whole step , corresponding to two semitones. Half step = semitone. The same thing! Whole step = 2 semitones An interval is measured in half steps, which means there are 12 intervals per octave, just like there are 12 piano keys per octave. In a higher or lower octave, it all repeats the same way. # of half steps Interval name 0 Perfect unison 1 Minor second 2 Major second 3 Minor third 4 Major third 5 (Perfect) fourth 6 Tritone 7 (Perfect) fifth 8 Minor sixth 9 Major sixth 10 Minor seventh 11 Major seventh 12 (Perfect) octave Each interval has a different level of tension/release and emotional impact (that depends on the context where it is used). Let's find the perfect fifth of note C (marked in blue). According to the table, we must go up 7 semitones (piano keys). The fifth of a C is G (marked in green)! Fifth intervals sound very clear and often have a heroic or majestic emotional component when played upwards. Fifth interval upwards: Your browser does not support the audio element. What about the minor third of F (marked in blue)? That's 3 semitones (piano keys) away. 1, 2, 3… A-flat (marked in green)! Minor thirds have a mellow, darker sound often interpreted as sad or melancholic. Minor third upwards: Your browser does not support the audio element. Fun fact : The tritone (6 semitones) has been labeled the devil's interval due to its dissonant sound. Tritone upward: Your browser does not support the audio element. Knowing your intervals lends you the superpower to write compelling melodies. Melody Melodies are some of the most essential elements of music. They are usually the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of your favorite song. A melody is a sequence of notes with varying intervals. It can be sung with the voice or played by musical instruments. Here's an example of a famous, simple melody (\"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\"). It goes C-C-G-G-A-A-G. \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\": Your browser does not support the audio element. Is it a sequence of notes? Check! Can it be sung ? Well, it's a famous lullaby. Check! Does it have varying intervals ? Let's see. It goes from C to G in a perfect fifth (7 semitones). Then, it goes from G to A in a major second (2 semitones). And ultimately, back from A to G in a major second (2 semitones). Varying intervals : Check! Most melodies are made up of notes from one scale. Scales The scale is the foundation for melody and harmony. They are note sequences, like melodies, but scales always follow a specific interval pattern . They are like encoded instructions of half and whole steps. There are two main types of scales: major and minor. Major sounding generally bright or happy, and minor sounding more mellow and dark. Together, the notes in a scale make up a key and overall feel of a song; based on the scale, you pick the melody notes and harmonies. Scales usually contain 7 notes and span one octave. They always end on the same note they started with (\"root note\"), just one octave above. The key of C major has the following notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. C major scale: Your browser does not support the audio element. Notice how joyful and pure it sounds. Scales are named after the first note in the scale, followed by a code name. Code names like \"major\" or \"minor\" stand for the interval pattern. Every major scale has the interval pattern W-W-H-W-W-W-H . Every minor scale has the interval pattern W-H-W-W-H-W-W . (W = wholestep, H = half step) Feel free to double-check: The 7 notes of the C major scale C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and back to C are indeed spaced in a W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern! You can play the C major scale by starting from C and playing only the white notes on the keyboard. They are laid on in a way that the white keys follow the W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern. Similarly, only the white keys starting from note A result in the A minor scale ( W-H-W-W-H-W-W pattern). A minor scale: Your browser does not support the audio element. If both scales contain only white keys, that means that the C major and A minor scales share precisely the same notes, right? Absolutely. That's why they are called relative keys. Relative keys go very well with each other in a song. Relative keys share the same notes on the scale. Relative minors are always 3 semitones below the relative major (e.g. C major → A minor). Remember the minor third interval (3 semitones) we built in the note intervals section earlier in the chapter? We said it sounds dark and sad. That's because the minor third interval is the most defining part of a dark-sounding minor scale. The minor third is a whole step plus a half step (3 half steps in total) up from the root note. If you look at \" W-W-H-W-W-W-H \" and \" W-H-W-W-H-W-W \" above, which one starts with a whole step + a half step? The second one: W-H ! The W-H , in the beginning, is the secret formula hidden behind the term \"minor\" when it comes to scales. Modes Modes are like slight variations of the same scale. They change the whole-step and half-step formula for a little extra flavor. The typical Western music we hear today uses mostly Ionian (\"major\") and Aeolian (\"minor\") modes. Remember the steps? W-W-H-W-W-W-H for major, and W-H-W-W-H-W-W for minor. But many other interesting modes spice up a scale by altering one or two steps. Modes give us access to a world of sound that we wouldn't otherwise have access to within the major and minor scales alone. Here's a reference list of all modes. Don't bother memorizing them for now. (W = whole step, H = half step, WH = whole step + a half step) Mode Formula Major scale W-W-H-W-W-W-H Natural Minor scale W-H-W-W-H-W-W Minor pentatonic scale WH-W-W-WH-W Blues scale WH-W-H-H-WH-W Major pentatonic scale W-W-WH-W-WH Harmonic Minor scale W-H-W-W-H-WH-H Melodic Minor scale W-H-W-W-W-W-H Ionian scale W-W-H-W-W-W-H Dorian scale W-H-W-W-W-H-W Phrygian scale H-W-W-W-H-W-W Lydian scale W-W-W-H-W-W-H Mixolydian scale W-W-H-W-W-H-W Aeolian scale W-H-W-W-H-W-W Locrian scale H-W-W-H-W-W-W Whole tone scale W-W-W-W-W-W Whole-Half Diminished W-H-W-H-W-H-W-H Half-Whole Diminished H-W-H-W-H-W-H-W Try out a few on your piano or a virtual keyboard . Start from the C and go up each mode's half and whole steps. You'll notice that they sound a bit different . The Lydian mode, for example, often creates an \"otherworldly\" mood. John Locke's theme by Michael Giacchino (from my all-time-favorite TV series Lost) starts with a piano playing the Lydian scale. Lydian scale intro from John Locke's Theme: Your browser does not support the audio element. Knowing your modes increases the range of moods and atmospheres you can create in your orchestral compositions. Chords What are chords? Chords are groups of notes played together at the same time. We use them to create a sense of structure as we move from one section of a song to another. They can be used to create tension and release to make a piece exciting or add color and depth to an existing melody line. Melody without chords: Your browser does not support the audio element. The most basic chord is stacked thirds, either major or minor thirds. These chords are called triads . The C major triad is made of the notes C-E-G (major third + minor third interval), and the C minor triad of the notes C-Eb-G (minor third interval + major third). The 1 and 5 are the same between a major and minor triad. The most frequently used chords are from the first, fourth, and fifth notes of the song's key; for the C major scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C), that would be C major , F major , and G major . Chords can be simple or complex, depending on how many notes make up each chord. Most songs use simple three-note chords like C Major or F minor. But you can add notes to a chord to change its emotional connotation and make it more nuanced. The Jazz genre is famous for its complex chords. A chord progression is a group of chords played one after another. No other musical element has a more significant effect on a track's overall mood and atmosphere than the chord progression. Melody with a chord progression: Your browser does not support the audio element. Same melody with a different chord progression: Your browser does not support the audio element. Chord voicings and inversions Chord voicings are ways to arrange the notes of a chord across octaves. In a triad, you have the root note followed by stacked third intervals. But you could also move a third interval to the low bass range and have the root note play very high. Or remove one chord note altogether. Each voicing of the same chord sounds unique and tells the listener a slightly different story. Inversions are a type of chord voicing. An inversion is when you play the notes of a chord in a different order. For example, if you play all three notes of a C major triad (C-E-G) in one octave (the original voicing), you get this: C major triad (C-E-G): Your browser does not support the audio element. If you play them again but move the C up like so... C major triad but with C stacked on top (E-G-C): Your browser does not support the audio element. ...you've just played the first inversion of C major —but it still sounds like C major! It's just different from before because now E is the low note. If we move E - currently the lowest note - up an octave like this... C major triad but with C and E stacked on top (G-C-E): Your browser does not support the audio element. ...that's our second inversion . Like voicings, you can make a chord more interesting with inversions. Wherever a triad sounds bland and uninspired in your track, try changing around the notes (inversions) and space them out across the keyboard range (voicings). Conclusion Music theory is essential for understanding everything from pop music on the radio to the most complex classical pieces. It also helps us understand why we like or dislike certain pieces of music. Suppose someone hears a piece with dissonant chords, then another with consonant chords (chords that sound good together). In that case, they might prefer one over the other even though they're both composed by Mozart! Unless it's the score for a horror movie. This is because learned preferences evolve based on exposure to certain styles over time; everyone has developed personal tastes based on their own experiences. Much of the music you hear on the radio comprises simple melodies, harmonies, and rhythms. But there's a lot more to it than that! Music theory can help you understand how those elements work together and gain a new level of control in your compositions. These were only the absolute fundamentals of music theory. In this chapter, we've learned a lot. But there is much more out here to be explored, and it will take a much longer time for you to master all those more advanced concepts. But, we are now in a place where we can writing music ourselves!

              "content": "PREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CHAPTER 2 - BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PRODUCTION The Orchestral Sections and Instruments An entire universe of sound. Author: Kevin Kuschel Reading time: 22 mins The orchestra is a complex beast. It's a large musical organization with up to 100 instrumentalists and each plays a specific role in the bigger whole. This chapter is a first introduction to the sections of an orchestra and the instruments that make up those sections. We’ll learn what they do and why they're important to the ensemble. Table of Contents Classical vs. Hybrid orchestral music String section Brass section Woodwind section Orchestral percussion section Untuned vs. Tuned percussion Classical vs. Hybrid orchestral music From a modern composer's perspective, there are two types of orchestras: The more traditional 'classical' orchestra and the cinematic 'hybrid' orchestra. The classical orchestra is defined by how it sounds and is made up. Classical music is often considered 'classical' simply if it was written before the 1900s. Some of these composers include Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Stravinsky, Mozart, and Beethoven. The term 'classical' can also describe music written after the 1900s with the same stylistic characteristics as the classical period. The typical classical setup consists of strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. It is powerful enough to fill a concert hall with sound but delicate enough to play high-speed passages without blurring together. Cinematic orchestral music is considered 'hybrid' if it involves synthetic or electronic instruments. The sound of this modern style originates from current film scores and video game soundtracks. Hybrid orchestras mix acoustic instruments (strings/woodwinds/brass) and electronic instruments (synthesizers), creating the genre's signature sound. This synergy makes it possible to build huge walls of sounds very fast. There are a few things that make the hybrid orchestral genre so powerful: It has a big sound that quickly establishes a significant presence. The sonic palette is not limited by the natural sounds of instruments alone. It can be used in any genre or style of film or game score. Hybrid Orchestras are incredibly adaptive to meet the newest trends. In contrast, classical orchestras follow established conventions that have been proven for centuries. There is a large audience for both ends of the spectrum. In this guide, I will consider both orchestral music styles: Classical and hybrid cinematic. Personally, I write both kinds but lean more toward the modern style used in trailer music and video game soundtracks. You will have to decide which type of music you want to write, as it also affects the kind of sample libraries you'll purchase. In Chapter 5, we'll guide you through classical and hybrid cinematic sample library options . String section The string section is the largest and one of the most versatile parts of the orchestra. String instruments are incredibly expressive and have the power to evoke emotions from the deepest sorrow to the highest joy. The players don't rely on breathing to produce sounds like woodwinds or brass instruments. Therefore, they can play long passages without quickly getting tired. The section consists of violins , violas , cellos, and double basses . Each instrument has its own unique sound, and each has a different role in an orchestra. In terms of function, strings perform most of the melodies and harmonies in an orchestral piece. Still, they can also add lush and elegant texture. Strings are flexible powerhouses for both classical and modern cinematic music. It's my favorite section because the string family resonates with an energy that propels both the orchestra and my own feelings to a higher level. Violins The violin is the smallest, highest-pitched instrument in the string family. It is also the most popular instrument in classical music . Solo violin: Your browser does not support the audio element. Violin section: Your browser does not support the audio element. The violin plays in a higher range than any other member of its family. The instrument typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths and can play a note range from G3 to E7 or higher (!). It's most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also produce sounds by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato technique). It's bowed with a horsehair bow and held under the chin by an adjustable shoulder rest; this allows for greater freedom of movement during performance. The fingerboard has a nut at its upper end and a bridge at its lower end. The strings pass over the bridge and have their ends thread through holes at their top ends so they can be tightened or loosened with tuning pegs. The violin's body is hollowed inside and covered with a thin layer of wood called the soundboard. \"The true mission of the violin is to imitate the accents of the human voice, a noble mission that has earned for the violin the glory of being called the king of instruments.\" - Belgian violinist/composer Charles Auguste de Bériot (1802-1870) Violins often play the melody , providing a high, clear sound that is often used to convey emotion. Violins are often given vital parts in an orchestral composition. Violas The viola plays one octave lower than the violin. They are held under the chin like violins, and despite violas being marginally larger than violins, they look almost alike. Solo viola: Your browser does not support the audio element. Viola section: Your browser does not support the audio element. If you're a violinist, you might wonder what anyone would do with a viola. In fact, violinists are known to crack the occasional joke about the viola. Well, here's the answer: The viola often fills out harmonies and largely contributes to making the strings section sound fuller. Violists usually take care of the inner voices within a harmonic texture and support other instruments by reinforcing specific notes. Due to its rich timbre, they can take over soaring melodies or double the violins an octave below. Cellos Cellos are lower-pitched than violins and violas but higher-pitched than basses. The cello is said to have a similar range to the human voice and is similarly versatile in its functions . Cellos are also very warm-sounding compared to other instruments with higher notes like violins or flutes. Solo cello: Your browser does not support the audio element. Cello section: Your browser does not support the audio element. Held between the knees like a small double bass, the cello sometimes plays melodies but often functions as part of the harmony in orchestral music. It can double the bass notes, support parts played by other instruments, or provide a low drone effect, especially in cinematic music. The cello is often used as a solo instrument, either standalone or both in classical and hybrid orchestras. The most well-known solo cello piece is probably Bach's Suite No. 1 in G Major (BWV 1007) . Because of its voice-like range and lyrical expressiveness, the cello is often used in covers of popular songs these days. Double Basses The double basses are the largest instruments in the string family. The double bass is enormous and deep-voiced at more than six feet tall. It is most often used to play root notes as the foundation. Solo bass: Your browser does not support the audio element. Bass section: Your browser does not support the audio element. The double bass is the string section’s lowest-pitched instrument , sounding an octave lower than the cello. It provides a solid bass line for the rest of the instruments to build on and is indispensable for filling the low end of the frequency spectrum . It gives rhythm and adds depth and richness to the overall sound of the orchestra. Double basses are generally bowed but also often plucked for a warm, percussive pizzicato sound due to their voluminous, resonating body. When you hear a double bass in an orchestra, it often plays the bottom note of chords or walking basslines. The double bass is not an easy instrument to learn how to play well. However, once mastered, it's a rewarding experience that produces deep, resonant tones throughout an entire hall or concert stage. Conclusion Overall, the string family is extremely important in classical orchestral music, but also in music for Film and TV, video games, or trailers. It can add a certain sense of drama and emotion to the music. If a composer is looking for an instrument to evoke such feelings, they would be wise to look within the string section of an orchestra rather than elsewhere. Yes, the instruments in the string family might not possess the same level of visceral punch present in brass or percussion. But there is no doubting their importance to the backbone of an orchestra. Whether you're writing classical or epic hybrid orchestral music. Whether you need suspense or light-heartedness: The strings will likely have a significant presence in your symphonic compositions. Brass section The brass section is one of the most powerful sections in an orchestra. The brass instruments in the orchestra are played by forcing air through a cup-shaped mouthpiece. The shape of the mouthpiece makes the air come out in a column that vibrates in tune with the music being played. The vibrations create a sound wave that we hear as musical notes. The brass section includes trumpets , Fr ench horns , trombones, and tubas . One specialty of brass instruments is that they can attach various types of mutes to heavily change the instrument's timbre. Trumpets Trumpets are the highest-pitched brass instrument and one of the loudest instruments in an orchestra. Solo trumpet: Your browser does not support the audio element. Trumpet section: Your browser does not support the audio element. Trumpet players use 3 valves to lower or raise the pitch of notes by one semitone each. Its primary function is to play melodies but also plays rhythmic passages and accents, especially in the style of fanfares both in classical and modern cinematic orchestral music. Trumpet players must have strong lungs because they're required to hold their instrument at an angle while playing it. And they need good breath control, so they don't run out of air before finishing their piece! Apart from long notes and several types of shorts and repetitions, trumpets - and other brass section instruments - can use advanced techniques like flutter tongue, rips, and double-tonguing. French horns The modern French horn , or just horn, is made from a single sheet of brass rolled into a cylinder with a flared bell end. The bell end is bent back into itself to form an arched shape and then tightened with screws. Solo horn: Your browser does not support the audio element. Horn section: Your browser does not support the audio element. The player blows into the mouthpiece, which directs the sound through the instrument's large circular central opening at its base. This opening can be closed off using either a thumb valve or rotary valves spun by hand. The French horn is one of the most popular instruments in orchestral music for two main reasons: French horns are used in many classical pieces to play richly textured passages that add depth to the music. But especially in hybrid cinematic music, they are definitely in the top 3 of most iconic orchestral instruments. Why? Because of their ability to shout out heroic melodies like no other orchestra instrument. The horn section is an undisputed staple in modern epic orchestral music. Usually, it leaves no question about who's the boss in the main theme. Though many classical film score gems, e.g. by John Williams (Indiana Jones, Star Wars), have the trumpet responsible for the bold, majestic statements, there is a clear shift toward the horns in modern soundtracks. Trombones The trombone has a powerful sound and can be heard clearly over all of the other instruments in an orchestra. This makes it an essential part of any musical score. Solo trombone: Your browser does not support the audio element. Trombone section: Your browser does not support the audio element. Trombones are lower-pitched than trumpets but still have a bright sound . Trombone players use a slide to change pitches instead of valves and usually play slower passages than, for example, trumpets do. The slide can be moved in either direction (up or down) along its length. This movement creates different pitches depending on where you put it. It makes for a highly flexible instrument. They are not limited to specific keys or fingerings. They can play any note in any key by smoothly moving from one pitch to another. Usually, when saying trombones, people mean tenor trombones specifically. There's also a lower-pitched brother called bass trombone , often called upon to play low notes for dramatic effect. In epic orchestral and hybrid orchestral tracks, the trombones frequently play fifths or chords above the bassline. Solo bass trombone: Your browser does not support the audio element. Because of their clear sound, trombones can play chords even in low ranges without creating too much muddiness in the mix . Trombones play in a similar range as cellos and bassoons, and 3 trombones often harmonize to play a chord. Tubas The tuba , a.k.a the bass tuba, is the lowest-pitched brass instrument in the orchestra and is typically used to play bass notes. The tuba has been used by composers ever since as a way to add power or drama. In addition to marches, it's also been used in military music and jazz compositions. Solo tuba: Your browser does not support the audio element. In opera, it's often used for low notes in the so-called \"basso profundo\" range that would be impossible for most people to sing. In modern symphonic music, the tuba usually plays two types of parts: 1) sustained pitches (bass lines), which are typically played on long notes; and 2) short, loud notes to punctuate a piece or section of music (melodic figures). Conclusion The brass section is key to any orchestra and is best known for its loud, powerful sounds that can be heard over an entire orchestra. From the deep, rich sound of the tuba to the high, piercing notes of trumpets and trombones, these instruments provide a critical element in any piece of music. It's not just about their sound; they also add an impressive visual element to performances. Brass instruments, like trumpets and trombones, have a louder sound than the woodwinds (clarinets, oboes, and flutes). Each instrument has a different timbre or tone quality that makes it unique from other instruments in the same family. Woodwind section The woodwind section is one of the smallest sections in an orchestra. It consists of flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons. The woodwind section plays a vital role in creating an orchestra's musical texture and harmony, despite being often overlooked in today's epic orchestral music due to not being as flashy as the strings or as powerful as the brass. But know this: A well-arranged woodwind section can make your heart melt. Let's take a closer look at each instrument in this section. Flutes Flutes are the highest-pitched of the woodwind instrument family. They are made of wood, metal, and plastic in various combinations. The most common flute is a transverse flute, which is held horizontally. The standard flute range covers three octaves, from the middle C (C4) to C7. Solo flute: Your browser does not support the audio element. Flute section: Your browser does not support the audio element. When seeing one, you might wonder if the flute is a brass instrument because it's mostly made of metal. But know this: Not only were flutes historically made out of wood, but the material they are made of is actually secondary. Flutes are considered woodwind instruments for how they produce sound by splitting the incoming air against a lip plate or the edge of a reed. Brass instruments, on the other hand, such as trumpets and trombones, amplify the sound produced by a musician's vibrating lips. That's why flutes (and even the brassy-looking saxophones!) are considered woodwinds. Other types of flutes include piccolos (the highest woodwind in an orchestra), alto flutes (larger and lower in pitch), and bass flutes (very large). Some composers use these different sizes because they want their music to sound like birds singing or something magical happening underwater! Composer maestro John Williams is famous for using flute textures and fast runs in the high register (e.g., in legendary Hedwig's Theme from the Harry Potter OST ). Still, they also play melodies in the upper octaves. Oboes Oboes are among the higher-sounding members of the woodwind family. The range of the oboe reaches from Bb3 to somewhere around G6 . Solo oboe: Your browser does not support the audio element. Oboe section: Your browser does not support the audio element. Oboe notes sound quite nasal and piercing (or quacky) in the higher dynamics because they are double reed instruments. The oboe is used in classical orchestras, military and marching bands, and folk music. Sometimes, you'll find it in jazz ensembles and big bands. Oboes are also frequently used to play solo lines in orchestral music, such as Richard Strauss' Alpine Symphony. With its prominent sound, a single oboe solo can be easily heard in the concert hall. A prominent cousin in the oboe family is the lower-pitched English horn , or cor anglais, which produces a more tamed, mellow sound. Clarinets Clarinets have been around since the early 1700s. Solo clarinet: Your browser does not support the audio element. Clarinet section: Your browser does not support the audio element. They come in many sizes and variations: soprano , alto , tenor , and bass clarinets . Clarinets are known for their wide range producing everything from high soprano to low bass sounds, with the lowest note on bass clarinet reaching down to Bb1 . The clarinet has a rich, complex sound with many overtones or formants. In the orchestra, clarinets usually play lower to mid-range to give space for the flutes and oboes above. They blend very well with other instruments of the orchestra like the other woodwinds as well as French horns. Bassoons The bassoon is the lowest double-reed instrument. It has a soft, airy sound , but - as with all the other double reed woodwinds - you can also find some of that nasal flavor in its timbre. Solo bassoon: Your browser does not support the audio element. Bassoon section: Your browser does not support the audio element. The other member of the bassoon instruments is the lower-pitched contrabassoon , the largest wind instrument in an orchestra. It mostly doubles the bassline played by the tuba and double bass. Solo Contrabassoon: Your browser does not support the audio element. The bassoon range extends from Bb1 to roughly between D#5 and G5 , whereas the contrabassoon can go as low as Bb0. Holy cow! Bassoons sound mellow and beautiful and are great for enriching your orchestral sound. If you want them to stick out, e.g. in a solo part, you will have to make space for them and reduce the volume or section size of the accompanying instruments. Conclusion The flute section is relatively small, with rarely more than 2 or 3 players per instrument. Modern orchestras focused on an epic cinematic sound often leave it out entirely to focus on the strings and brass sections. This is a bit of a shame because woodwinds blend beautifully with the other instrument families and enrich the overall sound. Woodwinds are underrated these days. But worry not: Trends are getting saturated, and I am pretty confident in a serious woodwind revival not only in concert music but also in film, TV, and video game scores. Sooner rather than later. Orchestral percussion section The percussion section defines any orchestra. Let's be honest, all groups are important; else, they wouldn't have survived the centuries. But orchestral music would be dull and washy without the rhythmic accents and drive provided by the various drums , metals , shakers , and more. Orchestral percussion includes a variety of instruments that produce sound by being hit or struck, such as drums , cymbals , and gongs . Other instruments have their own pitches by vibrating like wind chimes do. These include timpanis , xylophones , glockenspiels , and even tubular bells (among the most beloved instruments in cinematic music!). Percussion instruments are lots of fun to play if you love music and rhythm. Unless you're that poor person who has to wait for a couple hundred bars just to play a few notes. But when your time comes, you shake the bones of everyone in the audience. But wait, if the percussion family is defined by being struck by something, then... Is the piano a percussion instrument? Or even a string instrument that should be placed next to violins and cellos? Pianos consist of dozens of strings struck by little hammers, right? And if none of these, what family is the piano in ? The piano is considered a chordophone (along with guitars and harps). Still, it is often seen as both a string and percussion instrument. There are different opinions among composers. In their DAWs, some composers add it to the percussion section; others prefer it separated at the very top or bottom of the template. There's no right or wrong here. Really, don't worry too much about it :) Untuned vs. Tuned percussion There are two types of percussion instruments: tuned and untuned . The difference is in the way they're designed. Untuned percussion doesn't produce distinct pitches and primarily serves rhythmic functions. In contrast, tuned percussion allows for greater accuracy when playing music with other instruments because each note can be played at its exact pitch. Untuned percussion Here's an overview of some of the orchestra's most iconic untuned percussion instruments. Concert bass drum A concert bass drum , or gran casa, is a large, flat drum with two heads. It's played with mallets and used to keep the beat and mark changes in a piece of music. Bass drum: Your browser does not support the audio element. They can define and emphasize certain parts by adding weight and function as a composition's heartbeat. Snare drum The snare drum is a shallow, circular drum with a snare strung across its lower head. The snare aims to produce that \"snap\" sound you hear in marches and military music. Like most orchestral percussion instruments, it has been adapted over time to fit into other styles of music such as jazz and rock. Snare drum: Your browser does not support the audio element. In orchestral repertoire, the snare drum is often used as a solo instrument to add excitement or punctuate important passages. Gong A gong is a large metal disk that produces a loud, resonant sound. They are usually bronze or brass, but some are made from other metals such as steel or aluminum. Gong players use mallets to strike the edge of the gong to produce different pitches. Because they produce such an intense tone, gongs are often used as punctuation devices. You'll often hear them right before big crescendos or at climactic moments when there's no doubt about how excited everyone is for what's about to happen next! Gong: Your browser does not support the audio element. Gongs can also be scraped for atmospheric effects that you'll often hear in tension or horror soundtracks. Taikos Traditionally used in Japanese folk music, these big Taiko drums are now used in many different styles of music worldwide for various reasons. The most common reason for using them is to create loud booming sounds that reverberate throughout the hall or stadium where they are being played. Taiko Ensemble: Your browser does not support the audio element. You'll often see Taikos in big ensembles with impressive choreographed performances. They are an essential part of epic percussion in cinematic music. You will understand why if you load up a taiko patch in your DAW or visit a live performance. Cymbals The cymbal is a metal disc that produces a loud, high-pitched sound. Striking a cymbal creates a \"crash\" that's perfect for adding energy to a new song part. Outside of the orchestra, they are essential to every modern drum kit. Cymbals are responsible for one of the most frequently (and most stereotypically) used effects in epic orchestral music: The cymbal swell . The percussionist repeatedly hits the cymbal to create a swelling crescendo that escalates into a massive climax. If you hear a cymbal swell, you know hell is about to break loose. Cymbals: Your browser does not support the audio element. Cymbals come in various sizes and shapes, such as crashes, rides, hi-hats, or china cymbals. They are usually played with drumsticks or soft mallets. Small percussion Small percussion can be anything small enough to fit in your hand and make a sound when you strike it. Shakers , for example, are great for adding a bit of rhythmic interest to any musical genre—jazz, rock, classical music. Because they're so easy to play and carry around (even during performances), there's no excuse not to own at least one shaker! Triangles are frequently used as an ornament to introduce a new song part and to add color to the orchestra. Small percussion: Your browser does not support the audio element. There are many other small percussion instruments like tambourines , castanets , hand drums , guiros , and countless others from all parts of the world. They are great for adding unique flavors to your compositions. Tuned percussion Let's take a look at typical examples for tuned percussion. Timpani Timpanis are awesome! They can be tuned to different notes, and you can set up multiple timpanis in front of you to play actual melodies - with drums! A timpani consists of a single drum and a frame, which allows the player to change the drum's pitch by tightening or loosening the head. The timpani is used in both classical music and cinematic soundtracks. Timpani: Your browser does not support the audio element. It can create various effects, depending on the piece being performed. Because of its tuned drums, it can double root notes of the double basses and tubas. But also create effects like timpani swells to announce new song sections and ramp up the intensity of a piece. You can go for a tighter, harsher sound with different mallets or keep things soft and mellow. Xylophone, Marimba & Glockenspiel These are tuned percussion instruments that look a bit like a piano keyboard. They are struck with mallets and produce pitched percussive sounds. High-pitched and ringing for the glockenspiel , mellow for the marimba , and short and clicky for the xylophone . The glockenspiel is perfect for emphasizing specific notes of a melody. It adds sparkle and helps melodies pierce through the composition. Glockenspiel: Your browser does not support the audio element. On the other hand, Marimbas and xylophones have an entirely unique, characteristic sound. The xylophone sound, for example, is often interpreted as playful and light-hearted, whereas marimbas sound sonorous and hollow. Marimba: Your browser does not support the audio element. Xylophone: Your browser does not support the audio element. Piano The piano is a jack-of-all-trades instrument. Used in many musical genres, it has an extensive range and can produce both subtle and soft or thundering and loud notes. Piano: Your browser does not support the audio element. The piano has 88 keys that can be played by striking or pressing down on them with the fingertips. A small hammer then strikes a corresponding string causing it to ring. Each key corresponds to a specific pitch (or note) on the keyboard. The piano also has pedals on its underside that can create various effects, like a sustained effect where multiple notes blend into each other. Pianos can play multiple notes at once . This ability to play chords, melodies, and harmonies simultaneously makes the piano the standard instrument for composers to sketch their musical ideas . It's also why DAWs use a \"piano roll\" to display the MIDI notes of your song. These notes are then transformed into sounds based on the virtual instrument or sample library you have loaded. Harp The harp has been around since ancient times! It's a plucked string instrument and another strings/percussion section hybrid like the piano. It's a chordophone because its sound comes from more than one string being played at once. Harp: Your browser does not support the audio element. The modern harp has 47 strings plucked with your fingers, a plectrum (pick), and a complex array of 7 pedals to affect the tuning. Harps are perfect for enriching chords and textures and adding soft percussive accents to a harmonic bed. A signature harp sound is the typical harp glissando often used in soundtracks to suggest a romantic, mystical or dreamy mood. Conclusion So there you have it. The orchestra's percussion section is an integral and diverse part of the orchestra, bringing us both familiar and unique sounds. There's always a need for percussion! As a percussionist, you can play multiple instruments in various styles and genres of music. Super cool!

Author: Kevin Kuschel Reading time: 19 mins When getting into composing orchestral music, there's no way around sample libraries . No matter if you're just a hobbyist writing purely for pleasure or an aspiring film, TV, or video games composer: You need to look into this to get realistic orchestral sounds out of your computer. In this chapter, we'll: Learn what sample libraries are Explore how they work Look at the best orchestral sample libraries for beginners. Sample libraries are exciting, and composers love talking about them. So, let's find out what it's all about. Table of Contents What is an orchestral sample library? What is sampling in music? Sampler Articulations Articulation switching Dynamic layers and round robins Microphone positions Best paid sample libraries for beginners Free and low-budget orchestral sample libraries What is an orchestral sample library? In short, sample libraries are digital audio files that contain snippets (or samples) of real instruments played by professional musicians. And these audio files are programmed so you can play them with a MIDI keyboard. The orchestral sections in Hollywood movies are often recorded at famous studios with a particularly stunning sound. You may have heard of the legendary Abbey Road studio. When watching a film with a soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, John Williams, or Ennio Morricone, you're likely listening to a real orchestra recording. However, music in all sorts of media - from film and TV over video games to your favorite epic orchestral music playlist on Youtube - is not always recorded with a real orchestra. Instead, they used sampling technology . If you think about it, it makes sense. Not all projects have budgets to produce with a 100-piece orchestra, where the cost of each minute of finalized music is in the thousands. And even if it has, composers usually prepare everything on the computer beforehand to save precious (and expensive) recording time. So yes, there is no way around it. Need help choosing the best orchestral sample libraries for your needs? Book your personal sample library consultation. What Is Sampling In Music? In the context of a sample library, the term sampling refers to a process where every single note of an orchestral instrument is recorded and saved as an audio file. The goal is that you can ultimately reproduce the sound of that instrument on your computer. Here's how it works: A company hires the strings section of - for example - the London Symphony Orchestra with all its 30+ violin players, 12 violas, 10 cellos, and 8 double basses. Not just the instruments but the actual professional musicians. They set them up in a recording hall with carefully adjusted microphones. Then they start sampling: Every single possible note is played with various types of volume and playing techniques and painstakingly recorded. The players perform long notes and short accents, pluck the strings with their fingers or scratch them for spine-chilling horror effects. These techniques are also called articulations , one of the essential sample library terms. High-quality sample libraries have many types of articulations you can combine to reproduce a realistic sound. These thousands of audio files are then programmed and mapped, so you can play them with a keyboard to get the sound of an accurate orchestral strings section. This final result is the sample library that you can purchase. You can buy it directly from the sample library developer's websites or third-party resellers (e.g. Best Service ). Prices reflect the vast diversity in sample libraries, ranging from 0$ freebies to 1000$ flagship libraries. Sampler You need sampling software to use a sample library. It crosses the bridge between the individual audio files, and you play them with your MIDI controller. Kontakt Player (free) vs. Kontakt Full (paid) The most popular sampling software is Kontakt by Native Instruments, which is available in free and paid versions . With the free Kontakt Player , you can only load those sample libraries specifically developed for Kontakt Player. Kontakt Full libraries only load in a demo mode and stop working after 15 minutes. You might ask: \"Why would companies create sample libraries you can only play with the paid version of Kontakt?\" Because Native Instruments takes a significant license fee for making your sample library available to everyone. Usually, only the larger library developers can afford to pay this. Smaller devs usually develop for Kontakt Full. For most of us, Kontakt is an annoying thing to buy. It doesn't give us that rewarding feeling of a shiny new sample library. And yet: I consider Kontakt Full a standard investment for every composer because it opens up a world of high-quality niche libraries by smaller developers. There are true gems (e.g. the Ethera Gold series with arguably the best vocal libraries on the market). Other samplers Sample library developers have also started releasing their own samplers to have more freedom on how they want to host their sample libraries. Examples are the SINEplayer from Orchestral Tools or Spitfire Audio's sample player . Other free alternatives are Decent Sampler or Sforzando . Kontakt is definitely the industry standard as of now. Articulations Long articulations The most frequent long articulations found in sample libraries are: Legato : Smoothly connected notes played with a single bow stroke. It's often used to play melodies with a beautiful, smooth sound. Sustain : Long notes without the legato transitions of a single bow stroke. Tremolo : Tremolo is a very fast repeated note with no variation in pitch. It's perfect to create tension or anticipation. Usually refers to string instruments. Flutter tongue : Tremolo-like technique of brass and woodwind instruments repeating one note very fast. Trills : A trill is a rapid alternation between two notes, usually either a half step or a whole step apart. Larger intervals are possible. True Legato vs. Scripted Legato True Legato True legato is the most realistic-sounding type of orchestral sample library. It uses samples from real players and instruments to capture the complex nuances of actual performance. This makes it possible for true legato instruments to transition smoothly between notes without any noticeable \"glitching\" sounds at the point where notes change. Scripted Legato This legato type is created with scripting software that mimics the way real instruments play. It simulates legato transitions instead of recording them and does not produce such realistic-sounding results. It might be good enough in some situations, mainly when the instrument is not exposed in a solo line but buried in the mix. Short articulations The most commonly used short articulations are: Sforzando : A note is played with accent or emphasis. Staccato : A short note. Staccatissimo : A very short staccato note Spiccato : Produced by bouncing the bow off the string rather than pressing down. Sharp percussive sound. Repetition : Very fast notes by partial tongue technique in brass and woodwinds instruments. Pizzicato : The string is plucked with the finger for a soft percussive sound. Articulation Switching An instrument will likely play more than just one articulation throughout an orchestral piece. It might switch back and forth between long and short notes several times in a single melody line. Therefore, it's also essential to switch up articulations in your virtual performances. Applying staccato to some notes and staccatissimo or spiccato to others makes an accented line of short notes sound much more convincing than relying on the same articulation. There are 3 ways of achieving this. All 3 workflows are used among composers, and there's no right or wrong here. It's a matter of taste (and habit): Keyswitches Keyswitches trigger articulations with MIDI notes either played by your MIDI keyboard or programmed in the piano roll. Sample libraries with multiple articulations usually have their articulations mapped to keys in the piano's low register. This way, you can play a melody with your right hand and trigger articulations with your left hand while playing. However, this only works if your keyboard has enough keys to reach down to the very bottom notes. Else, you'll have to program the keyswitches afterward. Expression Maps, Sound Variations, BRSO Articulate, etc. Some DAWs come with features that make switching articulations easier. In Cubase, it's called Expression Maps ; Studio One brands it as Sound Variations . For FL Studio, there's a 3rd party plugin called BRSO Articulate . With such articulation mapping features, you can select notes in your melody and assign them to an articulation from a drop-down list. You can even assign those articulations to a hotkey and switch them with the push of a key (or a Stream Deck button). This is pretty convenient but also comes at a cost. You will have to set up these mappings for each of your orchestral libraries unless you purchase them separately or are lucky to find free ones made by the community. Products like Babylon Wave's Art Conductor offer them as presets. Personally, I use this method, and it saves me a lot of time. Separate tracks A third thing composers do to switch between the articulations of an orchestral instrument is to distribute notes to separate tracks per articulation . This way, no articulation has to be changed. The Legato track only has legato notes, and the Staccato track only has the staccato notes, etc. This saves you the trouble of programming keyswitches or setting up expression maps. However, the downside is that your MIDI notes are now spread up much more, making melody lines harder to edit. This method is also more taxing on your system as more instances of your sample libraries have to be loaded (one per articulation). Experiment with these three options and see what feels most natural for you. There's no right or wrong here. The more comfortable you feel with your workflow, the faster you can write music. Time is money! :-) Dynamic layers and Round Robins (RRs) Sample libraries with multiple dynamic layers are recorded with several intensities (\"dynamics\") per note. For example, a strings library with 4 dynamic layers may have one note recorded in pianissimo , piano , forte , and fortissimo . You can blend through all of these layers seamlessly with the mod wheel. Make sure that your sample libraries come with multiple dynamic layers, so you can phrase your melodies more expressively and ultimately more realistically. Round Robins Round-robin samples are another feature of orchestral sample libraries that allows you to get even more natural-sounding results when working in your DAW. A library has round robins when multiple takes of the same note are recorded. So that when you play the same note multiple times (especially in drums), you don't hear the same sample over and over again. Instead, you hear numerous variations of the same notes. This allows these samples to sound like they are being performed by real musicians with tiny sound inconsistencies. Without round robins, each note sounds 100% the same. Playing the exact same sample several times in rapid succession sounds robotic. This is called the \" machine gun effect \" and libraries with round robins prevent this effect from happening.

Microphone positions An orchestra's sound depends on many factors, including the hall, the instruments, and the musicians. As a result, the same orchestra can sound very different when recorded in different venues or with different equipment. A sample library's microphone positions make it sound close or far, narrow or wide. To give composers more tools to shape their sound, orchestral sample libraries come in multiple microphone positions . The most common are close , mid , and far . This allows you to mix the sounds together to get a more realistic mix of instruments playing at once. Mic positions significantly affect a sample library's file size. An infamous example is Spitfire Audio's BBCSO Pro with 20 different mic positions at over 600GBs. The reason for a library having multiple mic positions is that there are subtle differences in the sound of each of these positions. They can be used by a composer to go for a specific sound. Usually, libraries come with some form of close mic, a far mic, and a balanced mix. As a rule of thumb, close mic positions add more proximity and \"attack\" to the sound, while far or room mics add distance and \"blurriness.\" Orchestral snippet with close mics only (no reverb): Your browser does not support the audio element. Same snippet with far mics only (no reverb): Your browser does not support the audio element. Mic positions are handy: By balancing mic positions, you can move instruments to the front and back of your virtual space. However, if you're just starting out, I recommend you to go with the default mix first. Most orchestral libraries are recorded in situ with their original seating and, therefore, already well-balanced. For now, don't get lost in the details! :) There's always time to experiment with mic position adjustments once you are more familiar with all the steps of producing orchestral music. Best paid sample libraries for beginners \" What is the best orchestral sample library? \" is the most frequently asked question in every composer community. Ironically, mostly asked by beginners. And for a reason! Aspiring music producers don't want to go down the wrong route with purchase decisions they might regret later. Sample libraries are expensive. In response to that question, every experienced composer will tell you that it depends on what you are looking for. And that your skillset is what matters more. Professional composers make better-sounding tracks with 20-year-old samples than intermediates with the latest technology. Let's look at some sample libraries that can help you get started with orchestral music. I bought several orchestral sample libraries early in my composer journey, which were invaluable to me. Here is what worked well for me, but your needs may differ, so it's best to do your own research before making purchases. These libraries will be able to give you everything you need from a cinematic orchestra. From elusive and dreamy all the way up to epic and punchy, everything is possible. This is my personal subjective list and is documentation of what worked well for ME . You may have different needs and preferences, and it's best to do your own research before buying libraries. There are fantastic valid options by other developers, too. I will also name alternatives for each section that might work very well. You've been warned. All-in-one orchestra When I started my composer journey, I didn't know what style of orchestral music I would be doing. So, I wanted a modern sound that matched today's movie or video game production standards yet still offered enough versatility to explore more traditional orchestras. I needed to cover as much ground as possible, and an all-in-one orchestral library was the best solution to get started. First, I looked at Spitfire Audio Albion One because it was popular. Ultimately decided against it because I wanted control over each section in an orchestra. As a beginner in composing, I liked the freedom to apply what I learned about orchestration and instrumentation in my work. Not having complete control over section sizes would have limited this learning experience. Then just as I was researching, the perfect match for me was released: Nucleus by Audio Imperia . Nucleus has an impressive range of content and full section control over strings, brass and woodwinds, basic orchestral percussion, a choir, and a few capable solo instruments. There's even some cinematic sound design! It's all I needed to get started and more. A huge plus is its resource-friendliness . Nucleus runs well, even on most laptops. Two mix options for a modern (processed) and a more traditional sound are an excellent bonus for allowing me to experiment with both traditional and hybrid orchestral styles. Nucleus offers a full orchestra with a rich, modern sound and a simple yet effective workflow. One alternative to Nucleus would be Spitfire's BBC Symphony Orchestra Core . It captures a beautiful symphonic sound and offers complete section control with many articulations at a similar price point. Orchestral Tools Berlin Inspire serves a similar purpose. However, it offers less flexibility with the sections, using group patches like high and low strings. Compared to Nucleus, BBCSO and Berlin Inspire lean more towards the classical orchestral sound. All-in-one orchestras like Nucleus and BBCSO Core are perfect for getting you started. For cheaper options, Nucleus LITE and BBCSO Discover (FREE!) are great entry points into the orchestral range for a low price. Plus, they offer reasonable upgrade paths as your budget increases. You're already well-equipped to write high-quality orchestral music if you grab one of the flagship all-in-one orchestras. Learn your tools well, and you'll be able to write entire symphonies with Nucleus or BBC Symphony Orchestra alone. But let's go one step further and look at sample libraries for the dedicated instrument sections like strings, brass, woodwinds, etc. Strings After using Nucleus for a while, I wanted to enhance my favorite section—the strings. Everyone was talking about Cinematic Studio Strings at the time because it was new. After weeks of learning how to use it properly, I also started liking what I heard. Years later, that legato is still one of my go-to patches when composing strings arrangements in my orchestral tracks. Cinematic Studio Strings excels at its brilliant legato, romantic tone and highly consistent handling. The beautiful, romantic tone is consistent across all articulations and patches. Suppose you're using other Cinematic Studio Series products as well. In that case, there's beautiful connectivity between your different libraries. Pacific Ensemble Strings by Performance Samples is another great pick if you're looking for a large, symphonic sound with fantastic playability. Percussion I love my All-in-one orchestra Nucleus, but the variety of percussion instruments was limited. I wanted to write some epic stuff with taiko and tom ensembles, big bass drums, and energizing high percussion. When Damage 2 by Heavyocity came out—just when I felt ready for it—it was a no-brainer recommendation for the first versatile flagship percussion library. Damage 2 contains a wide variety of organic and world percussion instruments as well as epic cinematic drums with hybrid and industrial processing. I would recommend it as the first choice for a flagship percussion library. Damage features a huge range of organic and hybrid cinematic percussion. Its playable drums are laid out on an intuitive stage matrix (left to right, front to back) and can be repositioned with drag-and-drop. If you're looking for something less expensive but still extraordinary, I'd recommend Strezov Sampling's Percussion Essentials X3M . It's a compilation of Strezov's whole percussion range, from orchestral to ethnic to cinematic percussion (I reviewed it here ). I've also heard good things about Hans Zimmer Percussion if you want that big cinematic sound. Choir In the beginning, Nucleus is a great way to familiarize yourself with your choir section. But it's hard to beat Strezov's Choir Essentials for that price. It's a straightforward choir collection that gives you the basics you need at an incredibly affordable price. With true polyphonic legato for men and women, short syllables, a children's choir, and an energetic ensemble performance patch, Choir Essentials is popular among beginners. And you can get it for close to 100$ on sale. Check my video overview to hear it in action. Choir Essentials includes premium features like polyphonic true legatos and a children's choir at an affordable price. Suppose a traditional separation into Soprano, Tenor, Alto, and Bass (SATB) patches is not a strict necessity for you. In that case, Chorus by Audio Imperia is a fantastic workhorse. It might be the only bread-and-butter choir library you'll need (I made a video ). Brass Here's a great all-rounder: Cinematic Studio Brass . The concept of CSB is similar to that of the Cinematic Studio Strings: a versatile bread-and-butter library with a consistent sound, gorgeous legato, and all the necessary articulations in medium section size. Picking Cinematic Studio Brass was an easy decision for me at that time. To this day, it's an absolute staple in my orchestral template. Cinebrass by Cinesamples is a popular alternative to Cinematic Studio Brass if you're looking for a brighter, more Hollywood-style brass sound. A real heavy-hitter both in price and quality is Tom Holkenborg's Brass by Orchestral Tools. Woodwinds I didn't get into using dedicated woodwind samples for quite a while. I was delighted with the Nucleus winds as they served me well and started my orchestral writing journey. However, once I began using other libraries like Cinematic Studio Woodwinds , I achieved a more robust sound in terms of versatility and character. Cinematic Studio Woodwinds offers a better legato, more instruments, detail and dynamic layers than the woodwind patches of an all-in-one orchestra. Free and low-budget orchestral sample libraries Plenty of options are available even if you're a composer on a tight budget. This paragraph will present some of the best free and low-cost orchestral sample libraries . Spitfire LABS Spitfire Audio is well known for its high-quality sample libraries. LABS is Spitfire's ongoing series of completely free instruments. LABS contains a bit of everything, including orchestral instruments, synths, ambient and experimental textures, and folk and world instruments. There's some funky stuff in it! Spitfire Originals Spitfire Audio also offers an Originals series as a step-up from the free LABS. Originals are priced at £29 / 29€ / $29 and provide greater detail and better functionality than the free instruments. They refer to themselves as essential cinematic ingredients and come at a very affordable price. Orchestral Tools SINEfactory After releasing their own sampler SINE, Orchestral Tools established an ongoing stream of high-quality freebies called SINEfactory . These include a church organ, studio percussion, strings and woodwinds instruments, a ukulele, and many more :) Same story here as with LABS: You don't need any external sampler like Kontakt. The instruments all run within SINE, which is free. Heavyocity Foundations A little while ago, Heavyocity started a Foundations series of freebies that make you feel like you're playing a paid product. These run in the free Kontakt Player and combine organic instruments like a piano, a strings section, or a nylon guitar with their signature cinematic sound design. All in a highly polished user interface. All for free. Heavyocity Foundations offers a selection of high-quality freebies for cinematic scoring like Foundations Staccato Brass. Performance Samples Freebies Performance Samples has several free libraries in their catalog that make you wonder, \"WHY don't they sell them for money?!\". They're just so good. Performance Samples' freebies primarily include strings instruments like a solo violin and solo cello but also ensemble patches . Some of these samples simply haven't made it into a final product because they were re-recorded at some point. Others are limited (but useful!) demo patches of their flagship libraries. Conclusion Even though I believe each of the library picks in this chapter can become an invaluable tool for your own composer journey, know that the modern-day composer has a massive palette to choose from . Do your own research. Don't rely on me or anyone else to tell you what's good and bad. Get out there and listen to as many libraries as you can. Check out demos and watch YouTube videos. And be aware that Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) can seriously impact your mental health and wallet. The free and budget libraries I listed are perfect for building your sound palette and finding some true gems out there. They probably won't replace a comprehensive all-in-one orchestra or a professional section library , as they focus more on one specific function. But I can confidently say that these freebie series are all worth looking into and will significantly boost your selection of music production tools. Now that you understand the basics of articulations, dynamic layers, round robins, and mic positions, you know what to look for. Find the libraries that speak to you, and those are the ones you should buy.

Author: Kevin Kuschel Reading time: 9 mins For many composers, an orchestral template is the best thing since sliced bread. This chapter covers the steps, techniques, and thought processes behind building an orchestral template. The concepts are the same for each DAW, whether you use Cubase, Logic, Studio One or Reaper. Table of Contents Why use an orchestral template? Template structure Build your template in 10 simple steps Why use an orchestral template? With an orchestral template , you open your DAW and immediately find your favorite sample libraries loaded up and organized. Building an orchestral template is key to getting to know the ins and outs of your DAW. Imagine this: You have a strings section folder with violin 1, violin 2, viola, celli, and double bass tracks, followed by a brass section folder with your brass instruments. The same goes for the other sections. Everything is neatly prepared : The libraries are set up the way you want, for example, purged with the internal reverb turned off. All is routed correctly. And the tracks already have the right negative track delay applied. In short, you fire up your DAW and are ready to go . In this chapter, we'll go through 10 easy steps to create an orchestral template from scratch. You can find a handy checklist of the 10 steps included in your Orchestral Music Production Starter Kit . Haven't grabbed Your Orchestral Music Starter Kit, yet? Kickstart your composer journey with our best collection of free music production resources. Includes: ❗ Requirements For Beginner Composers 🗺️ Music Theory Quick Guide ✅ Orchestral Template Checklist 📃 Orchestral Instrument Ranges Table GET THE STARTER KIT » Orchestral templates are helpful when writing an album or working on a project where you're scoring for film, writing production music for TV and trailers, and more. Especially when writing similar styles of music regularly, one consistent template will save you hours and hours in the long run. If, for example, Cinematic Studio Strings are your go-to strings, wouldn’t it be wasted time if you had to select, load, and prepare each CSS patch time and time again for every new song? Templates are great because they do this for yourself, giving you a solid foundation. You can create variations of your template to fit different projects. Perhaps your epic template can eliminate the woodwinds and world instrument section and add a trailer effects folder instead. You can then switch templates based on the needs of your project. There’s another benefit to building a template as a beginner. By creating tracks, folders, buses, and organizing and routing them, you’ll get good practice in navigating your DAW in a way that works for you. Of course you can also use templates that are not created by yourself. I bought two orchestral templates for my DAW Studio One when I started my composer journey. But - to be entirely honest - I never used them. It felt like working in someone else’s environment. Like entering a stranger’s home and trying to find the toilet (in the dark!). Instead, I spent a few days diving into the ins and outs of Studio One and made one myself. Youtube tutorials, composer community groups, and a good portion of trial and error finally made it click. After several projects full of clicking in the wrong places and being lost in menus and dialog windows, for the first time, I felt in control . That feeling of general cluelessness had finally vanished. It was so worth it. Because I made that experience earlier on my composer journey, I am convinced now that building your template from scratch is fantastic. No matter if you’ll end up using it a lot or not. However: Don’t feel forced to use a template just because many composers do. Instead, try to constantly evaluate your workflows and find shortcuts to accelerate your most frequently used actions inside the DAW. Find out yourself if a template helps you achieve this, or if you can find a better way. One example that works for me very well is creating modular blocks of track presets that I can drag into my project as I need them. Template structure Your template is your home . And unlike me using someone else’s template in the beginning, you’ll know where the toilet is. I’m not saying these are the correct way of doing things. Take it with a grain of salt and tailor things to your preference and workflow. You might even get ideas from using foreign templates for your own. First, here's how I structure my orchestral template in the big picture: Create a folder for the instrument section (\"STRINGS\" in this example) and add folders of all your strings libraries (\"CSS\", \"SCS\"). In each library folder, then add the instrument patches (\"VIOLINS 1\", \"VIOLINS 2\", \"VIOLAS\", \"CELLI\", \"DOUBLE BASSES\") The instrument sections are on the highest hierarchy level: Strings, Brass, Woodwinds, Percussion, etc. To each of these, we’ll add subfolders of sample libraries : Cinematic Studio Strings, Berlin Strings, Pacific Ensemble Strings, etc. And in each of those library folders, we’ll place the instrument patches we want: Violins 1, Violins 2, Violas, Cellos, Basses, etc. Organizing folders by sample library makes it easy for us to hide and deactivate library folders that we won’t need for a specific project. This helps us get a better overview of our project. Tip: You can also do it the other way round: First the instrument groups (Strings, Brass…), then instrument folders (e.g. Violin 1, Violin 2,...) and inside each of those instrument folders the respective sample library patches (Violin 1 CSS, Violin 1 Berlin Strings, Violin 1 Pacific Strings). Here are some of my personal preferences regarding orchestral templates and DAW workflows. Some of these spark rather hot debates among composers :) Find a workflow in your DAW that works fast and reliable for you. My findings are based on years of deliberate work, mistakes, trial and error, and ultimately: improvement. Feel free to get inspired and try adopting them to your own routine when composing. Multi vs. single patches I prefer using multi-patches (all articulations in one patch) over individual single-instrument patches (e.g. only staccato articulation). That way, I can switch articulations quickly and on the fly, using either keyswitches or - much more convenient - Studio One's Sound Variations/Cubase's Expression Maps or other articulation mapping features. Kontakt routing Some people add multiple instruments into the same Kontakt instance and use the MIDI channel to route them to several tracks in your template. Honestly, this is too complicated for me. I add only one instrument patch per Kontakt instance to save myself routing trouble with multiple Kontakt output channels. It doesn’t seem much more taxing on the CPU and feels more intuitive to me. I want to go for simplicity here. Purging If my computer has less than 64GB of RAM, I will purge all Kontakt instances in my template to save RAM and have a clean and lightweight start. If I have 64GB or more I don’t bother purging, because my system can load everything. Reverb: Inserts vs. sends You can add your reverb plugin as an insert effect directly on the tracks (or a folder bus) you want to apply it to, and set it according to the desired effect. Alternatively , you can create an effects channel with your reverb set to 100%, then route all your instrument tracks to the channel with different signal strengths. That way, you can achieve different amounts of reverb for each instrument or section with only one reverb insert for your CPU to process. I use one reverb insert effect for each instrument section , sometimes even just one reverb plugin on the master fader that applies to the entire project. One reverb insert per orchestral section (strings, brass, etc.) still gives enough fine control to reach the sound of a pro-level virtual orchestra. I guess I just don’t like routing things. Focusing on simplicity and modularity, let’s build our template. Build your template in 10 simple steps Disclaimer : This process gets a bit technical, but it's something you need to I documented the step-by-step process in a 5-minute video tutorial , which will be easier to follow. In any case, here's the written explanation with screenshots. I use Studio One, and it will work similarly with other DAWs. When building our orchestral template, we’ll work backward from sample library patch (e.g. Violin 1) to sample library subfolder (e.g. Cinematic Studio Strings) to instrument section folder (e.g. Strings). 1. Create a new project . Create a new project, give it a name and press OK. 2. Add Kontakt instances . Let’s start with the strings section. In Studio One, simply drag and drop the Kontakt instrument from the browser onto your empty track list. It will automatically create an instrument track with a loaded Kontakt instance. 3. Select the sample library patches you want and load them into each Kontakt instance. Ensure that each Kontakt instance's internal reverb is turned off if you plan to use an external reverb plugin. Purge all instruments if your computer has less than 64GB of RAM to be on the safe side when loading up your template. Load all sample library patches of your instrument group and adjust the settings to your liking. I deactivated the internal reverb and purged the samples to save RAM. 4. Name the tracks (e.g. VIOLINS 1, VIOLINS 2, VIOLAS, etc.) and pack them into a folder. 5. Name the folder according to your library (e.g. CINEMATIC STUDIO STRINGS). 6. Set the negative track delay for each track according to the sample delay of your library. I’d pick -60ms for CSS because that’s the sample delay for its shorts articulations. The legato timings I will manually adjust when recording melodies. I set the track delay of my Cinematic Studio Strings tracks to -60ms to compensate for CSS' 60ms delay on their short articulations. 7. (optional): If you have them, you can apply Expression maps (Cubase) or Sound Variations (Studio One) to each patch for quick articulation switching. I purchased Babylonwaves Art Conductor that comes with thousands of these pre-mapped articulation switches. In the beginning, I hesitated if it's worth the ca. $100 Dollar investment. But I quickly understood: For me, there's no turning back! It's just so nice not having to worry about keyswitching. I mapped the most important articulations to a button on my Stream Deck, and can switch articulations pretty much seamlessly. Tip: With s1toolbox.com by Lukas Ruschitzka, you can convert Cubase Expression Maps into Studio One Sound Variations with one click. For free. Now we have a library folder (in our case Cinematic Studio Strings) within our Strings folder that has all patches prepared with no internal reverb, purged RAM, a negative track delay, and active Sound Variations. If you have another strings library, you can do the same drill. Prepare the patches in the way you like them, don’t forget to set the correct negative track delay and pack them in a folder. You now have two strings library folders inside the strings folder. Each contains patches for violins, violas, cellos, and basses. Depending on your next project, you can hide the strings library folder you don’t want to use. 8. Once you have all strings patches prepared and organized, select them and add a bus channel . Place your reverb as an insert on this bus channel. It will now be applied to all patches inside the Strings folder. For me, one reverb per section (strings, brass, etc.) is enough, and - IF I wanted - I could still make fine adjustments on an individual patch level or add one reverb bus per library. But for now, I won’t. Drag and drop your favorite Reverb from the Browser onto the new Strings bus. It will be applied to all tracks in that bus (\"VIOLINS 1\", \"VIOLINS 2\", \"VIOLAS\", \"CELLOS\", \"BASSES\"). 9. Repeat the same steps for the Brass section, Woodwinds, Percussion, Vocals, Sound Design, and whatever you want to add to your template. And at the end, it will look something like this. The final folder and patch structure: All instrument groups (\"STRINGS\", \"BRASS\", \"WOODWINDS\", \"PERCUSSION\", \"SOUND DESIGN\") have their sample library folders (\"CINEMATIC STUDIO STRINGS\", \"DAMAGE 2\", etc.), which have their instrument patches (\"TRUMPETS\", \"FRENCH HORNS\", etc.). Each instrument group folder has a bus channel that can host effects like reverb. You can click on any track - like the Flutes in this example - and immediately play the correct instrument. You can open , close , and hide folders and immediately access all your instruments. With Expression Maps (Cubase) or Sound Variations (Studio One), you can switch between articulations in the same patch and even assign them to buttons on your keyboard. Good preparation pays off here. 10. Lastly, add a simple mastering chain if you have plugins for that already. A mastering compressor (e.g. Shadow Hills Mastering Compressor ) and limiter would be great here. I added a number of mastering plugins to the master channel: The Shadow Hills Mastering Compressor, Slate Digital's Fresh Air, Izotope Ozone 10, Sonnox Oxford Inflator and LEVELS by Mastering The Mix. These effects apply to the entire audio signal. If you wanted, you could add EQ inserts to instruments that you wish to adjust in their sound frequencies. For example, if you don’t like the warm tone of your CSS violins, you might already add brightness to them as part of the template. Personally, I’d do this later on in the mixing and mastering stage. Dragging and dropping an instance of Pro EQ as an insert effect from the Browser directly onto a track You now got the main framework for your new template by focusing on simplicity and modularity. You can easily add library folders to your instrument group buses or add entirely new groups to the template, like synths or world instruments.

Culture and Trends The sound of focus: ambient channels that help you sleep, relax, and concentrate By The YouTube Culture & Trends team Dec 05, 2025 Coined in the 1970s by musician and artist Brian Eno, ambient music was originally intended as an immersive, artful sound for close listening. Today on YouTube, the genre has transformed, its meaning shifting to a category shaped by its massive functional use cases. It has evolved into a broad spectrum “ambience channels” that blend music and visuals, specifically designed to help serve needs such as sleep , relaxation , and focus . These channels prioritize endless streams and long runtimes with looped visuals, perfect for background use. The sheer scale of this content's rise is undeniable: the YouTube channel Soothing Relaxation has received more than 4.8B channel views.* From stripped instrumentals for relaxation to videos featuring related genres like binaural beats, the community provides the perfect sonic backdrop for any task. Don't miss our unique YouTube logo (also known as the Yoodle) celebrating the creators who craft these digital ambient atmospheres on the 50th anniversary of Brian Eno's album Discreet Music .

Close out the year in style Recap will roll out to users in India this week. Your Recap can be found right on the homepage, or under the “You” tab, accessible on mobile devices and desktop . YouTube Recap uniquely highlights interests, deep dives, and moments you explored this year, based on your watch history. You’ll get a set of up to 12 different cards that spotlight your top channels, interests, and even the evolution of your viewing habits, or which personality type you fall into based on the videos you loved to watch! If you listened to a lot of music this year, you’ll also see Top Artists and Songs of the year as part of Recap, with the option to dive deeper into top genres, podcasts, and even a snapshot of your international music listening over on the YouTube Music app. Putting the ‘You’ in YouTube Recap was made for you, by you. This is reflected throughout the creation of this feature, with nine rounds of feedback and over 50 different concept testings before we landing on what you see today. After digging into how we all watch YouTube, we didn't just see data — we saw personalities , from the Adventurer or Skill Builder, to the Creative Spirit, and so many more. And here’s a fun discovery: the most common personalities were the Sunshiner, the Wonder Seeker, and the Connector, with the Philosopher and the Dreamer ending up as the more elusive and rare personas . Are you ready for a trip down memory lane? Revisit your favorite interests, discoveries, and moments with your Recap. And don’t forget to save and share your memories with friends! Posted in:",

              "content": "Copyright JUMP TO A SECTION Who is it for? Available in more than 80 languages, all rightsholders have access to the webform, which we’ve built as a streamlined and efficient way to submit copyright removal requests. **What does it do? ** Rightsholders enter a few details of their request, which is then reviewed by YouTube to see if it meets legal requirements for removing the reported content. Rights holders have access to powerful features, including the ability to ask YouTube to automatically prevent copies of the removed content from being reuploaded. Who’s it for? It helps creators and rights holders protect their content by automatically finding videos that are the same or very similar to ones previously uploaded. What does it do? If a match is found, the creator or the rights holder is notified. She can then review the video that potentially reused their content and decide whether to request the video’s removal. Who’s it for? Rightsholders who have the most complex rights management needs and experience heavy reposting of copyrighted material, like movie studios and music labels. What does it do? Rightsholders can pre-determine rules for when content matches are found — choosing to block a whole video from being viewed, monetize the video by running ads against it, or track the video’s viewership stats. How YouTube Addresses Copyright Claims Appeals The majority of copyright claims and removal requests on YouTube come from our automatic detection technology. We empower uploaders to report wrongful takedown requests, and we measure how often creators push back against removals and Content ID claims in our Copyright Transparency Report . Of the more than 1 billion Content ID claims made between July 2023 and December 2023, fewer than 1% have been disputed. Over 65% of those disputes succeeded, because claimants either voluntarily released the claim or did not respond within the 30-day window, resulting in the claim’s release. ( Source ) Explore more",

Author: Kevin Kuschel Reading time: 15 mins WHOA. You read that right. Your first orchestral track . You have all the basics and are ready to create your own orchestral piece. Here are some helpful tips on how you can get started. Table of Contents Preparation Create a piano sketch Main elements of orchestral music Steps to write orchestral music Preparation Before we start wildly scribbling down notes and recording melodies, there are things we can do beforehand that make the entire composition process easier. Visualize the piece Every composer has their own ways of coming up with ideas . Don’t see this as a set of fixed rules, but as an orientation you can rely on while figuring out the creative process that works best for you. Time to write your first composition! You first need to get a feel for the composition you're going to write. This is a part of what makes being a composer so incredible! \"Hearing\" something that isn't there yet, but lives inside you. And bringing it to life. Think about a sculptor who already sees a statue inside that block of marble but has to make it visible for others to see it. For you, that means to decide which musical concept you want to create. Is it a dramatic, intense piece? Or something more light-hearted and fun? Decide on this before you start writing , and stick with it. Composers often get distracted trying to fit too many ideas into one song. The composer often believes it makes the track more refined or sophisticated. In reality, it makes it harder for the listener to grasp and enjoy. Go for simplicity! Remember your audience - you’re likely to write music that’s enjoyed by the public, and not to please other composers. Find inspiration A single image in your mind might help set the mood you want to achieve. Examples could be an image of a massive spaceship bursting through the atmosphere of a fantasy ice planet , the apocalyptic remains of an ancient civilization or a lover's couple dancing through the clouds that you want to turn into sound. Think atmosphere rather than musical details. The details will follow your vision, eventually. If you like to approach music with an image in your mind, browse for artworks that make you feel something . You can also try using one of these AI image creation tools like Midjourney or DALL-E. These are fantastic to create inspiring images based on any input you feed them. Beginning is the hardest part and whatever helps you to start, is viable for the process. Perhaps you already have a musical idea in mind. This idea may be a melody, a chord progression, or simply a rhythm you wish to capture in your music. Develop an interesting main element you want your track to revolve around. Time signature and tempo Next, pick a time signature and tempo that works with your vision of the track. The most common time signatures are 4/4 and 3/4, with a tempo roughly between 80 and 140bpm. I recommend you start somewhere in this range. Most DAWs default at 4/4 with 120bpm, so that's a great starting point! You can go with crazier ones like 7/8 or 11/8 if your track demands it, for example, creepy horror cues. Now, think instrumentation . Best to keep things on a section level here. Instrumentation will significantly determine the entire sound of your composition. If you want a light, airy, melodic sound, then woodwinds and string instruments are probably a good choice. If you'd like something more aggressive, consider focusing on brass and ramping up the percussion. Epic cinematic music often leaves out the woodwind section entirely to focus on blending the remaining orchestral sections together with sound design. On the other hand, emotional, romantic pieces tend to focus on strings and woodwinds to create soundscapes that pull on your heartstrings. These are just general guidelines. Experiment with different instrument choices and combinations. Instruments blend like watercolors: Add cellos to your horn line for warmth and \"roundness,\" or add a sharp synth to your violins for more bite. With experience, you'll get a feel for which instrument combinations produce orchestral colors. Create a piano sketch Hold on for a sec! Now that we have a rough idea about how the instrument sections bring our mental image to life, we are entering a danger zone . Even for intermediate composers, the sheer number of choices when assigning and balancing the individual orchestral instruments easily overwhelms them. As a beginner, you'll quickly get lost in questions like, \"should I have the bassoons play the second voice or instead double the melody an oct ave below?\" You'll not be able to see the forest for the trees. Beginner composers lose hours trying to make their strings, brass, and woodwind sections work together. Still, a fix on one end creates friction on the other until it all becomes a frustrating mess. Whenever I’d just orchestrate straight ahead, I’d do all sorts of micro-adjustments that wouldn’t even matter: I’d change up the orchestration multiple times and all of those adjustments were wasted time after all. Be smarter than me. A valuable tip for clearly and efficiently outlining your orchestral piece is to start with a piano sketch. Even when you're not a pianist! Here's why: The piano is one of the few musical instruments that can play many notes at the same time while still sounding clear and well-balanced. You can use this to your advantage. Basically, what you will do with a piano sketch is write out the entire foundation of your orchestral song (the steps below) in one piano track. And once you get that done, you can distribute the different parts to orchestral instruments. Rule of thumb : If it sounds good and balanced on piano, it should sound good and balanced with the orchestra. The piano allows to spread out an entire orchestration over the range of 88 keys. Main elements of orchestral music You can usually break an orchestral track down into the following elements: Melody . The most prominent element with a singable quality. Often played in higher registers to stick out of the mix and doubled across octaves. Harmony . A secondary line that supports the melody and adds a sense of movement, or a textural bed of notes that gives context to the melody, e.g. by completing the notes to form chords. Bass . A low-register line that anchors the piece, e.g. by playing the root note of each chord or providing a pulse for syncopated rhythms. Rhythm . Carried mainly by the percussion section but also influenced by accents and hits from the melodic instruments. Adds emphasis or punctuation to a song. Decoration . Small flourishes that add interest and character to a song, e.g. high flute runs. Learn the best orchestral composing techniques with Orchestral Music Production For Beginners. Steps to write orchestral music Here's a great step-by-step guide for writing orchestral music as a beginner: Come up with a motif Turn the motif into a melody Add bass and harmonies to the melody Add chords to those harmonies. Add orchestral instruments by doubling these chords with different instruments. For steps 1-4, I recommend beginners start doing this with the piano alone. Then assign orchestral instruments to each of the elements. When writing an orchestral piece, you should keep those main elements in mind (Melody, harmony, bass, rhythm and decoration). You will need to balance and space them out in the frequency range and also throughout the different timbres of the orchestral instruments to come up with the atmosphere you intend to convey. Mastering this balance takes time and practice. Sometimes, your harmonies clash with the bass line because you arranged them in a low register or didn't voice the chords widely enough. Other times, your decoration causes friction with the melody because a high-pitched flute run bites into the high violin melody. That's okay, and it happens to everyone. Not only is fixing the balance much easier when there's only one piano track compared to re-arranging dozens of orchestral instruments. But also, by merging all of these 5 elements Melody , Harmony , Bass , Rhythm, and Decoration onto the same piano keyboard, you automatically pay attention that they don't overlap too much. Suppose you immediately go ahead and randomly start writing lines as they come into your head. You'll lose track of how much is already going on. Which parts of the orchestral frequency range from the lowest bass to the highest sparkle are already filled? Which are too empty? Fill the frequency spectrum In general, creating a natural and right-sounding orchestral arrangement has much to do with filling the frequency spectrum that I keep mentioning. The frequency range has to be evenly filled without missing areas or overly dense regions that will stick out like a sore thumb even to listeners who are not composers or musicians. Too high, too low, or too loud in some regions of the frequency spectrum can ruin an entire piece. You want to find that sweet balance where all elements are in equilibrium with each other yet stand out with their own unique character. Here are 3 writing tips for improving the frequency balance when composing orchestral music: The lowest instruments (e.g., basses, tubas) play fewer and slower notes , preferably the root notes of your chords. Double them in octaves or maximum fifth intervals. Smaller intervals will make the sound unclear and muddy. Exception : Trombones can play smaller intervals and even chords in lower registers because of their bright, crisp timbre. Medium-pitched instruments (e.g., cellos, clarinets) often play harmonies and support the melody or reinforce the bass an octave higher. They can harmonize the melody a sixth below or even double it an octave below. Don't arrange them too densely! The low-mid frequencies are the most common frequency buildup and are widely responsible for amateur-sounding mixes. The highest instruments (e.g., violins, flutes) play more and faster notes like melody lines and decorating runs. They can double the melody in an upper octave for a full, soaring effect or harmonize in a second voice (e.g., with third intervals) for an increased harmonic richness. Tip: Avoid harmonizing in third intervals at a low or low-mid range. Bass range : Root notes, double in octaves Mid-range: Reinforce bass or melody with harmony. Add textural beds of sustained chords (don't go below fifths). High range: Melody, ornaments, harmonize in thirds or other smaller intervals to add interest and sparkle. Double melody in octaves for soaring effect. A common misconception is that the mixing and mastering stage is responsible for nailing the sound quality of a track after you've finished composing and arranging the piece. But in fact, correcting an unbalanced mix can only fix (or hide?) around 10%, perhaps 20% of the issues in your composition. The arrangement is responsible for over 80% of its success or failure. Keep. Things. Simple. No matter how complex an orchestral might sound, you can mostly boil it down to 3-4 main ideas that happen simultaneously . Not more. Perhaps a melody in the upper mid-range, some decorative runs in highs, a counter melody in the lower mid, and a bass line in the lows. Complexity is then achieved with exciting rhythms, surprising harmonies, or unconventional choices for instrumentation. Be careful when overlapping lines of different instruments, or they will become blurry and undefined. Experienced orchestrators maintain clarity even when lines are in a similar range by picking instruments that vary in their natural timbre, rhythm, or playing technique. This way, there is contrast. You can still make out the details, and it doesn't all blur into a mushy sonic porridge . Similarly, you can write your orchestral track entirely on the piano keyboard. If it sounds good on a piano, it will most likely sound good with the entire orchestra. And if your arrangement sounds dense or sparse, muddy or airy, rumbly or sparkly, it'll translate to the orchestrated version, too. Create a motif When writing your first orchestral piece, it's essential to start small and build from there. The best way to do this is to create a motif . A motif is a short musical idea that has some sort of meaning or feeling attached to it. And most importantly: It gets repeated. For example, in \" Star Wars \", John Williams uses a motif that consists of four notes when Darth Vader appears on the screen. Motif of the Imperial March: Your browser does not support the audio element. People instantly recognize this motif and strongly connect it to Star Wars. It's engraved in their minds, and they associate something with it. The best way to create a motif is by thinking of something you want your piece to convey. If you are writing a song about love, think of the feeling of love and how it makes you feel. Then try to write down those feelings in musical terms using just a few notes . Once you develop the basic idea for a motif, think about how you can expand on it. If you have a four-note motif that represents love, repeat it but add a few more notes or change them up a bit while keeping the same rhythm to show different facets of love. Don't be afraid to use the same motif in various places throughout your composition; repetition helps tie together all the elements of your piece. I just came up with a quick example motif. I envisoned an intimate feeling of romance and an atmosphere of trust and security. No evil surprises here. Just cozy, warm love , expressed by playing around the major third interval: Example motif: Your browser does not support the audio element. Turn your motif into a melody Your main motif is the DNA of your piece. Not only should you present it at least once. But you also have to establish it. Give it weight and tell the listener: This motif is important. This is what you will remember. For that, we'll build a melody from the motif. Think of a melody as a sort of story arch for the motif. A motif alone is a bullet point. Making it into a melody turns bullet points into sentences. The sentence can go up, like a question, and down to provide the answer. Repeat the motif, or change up a few notes. But the sentences should breathe your track's DNA. Don't stray too far, or your composition is at risk of falling apart. Let's get back to the Imperial March theme once again: First statement of the Imperial March theme: Your browser does not support the audio element. It boldly presents the motif right at the beginning. And because it would be pretty dull to have it repeat over and over again, it changes up notes while keeping the same rhythm on the second run. Second statement of the Imperial March theme: Your browser does not support the audio element. The third statement breaks things up. Not only does the melody go higher than before, but it also changes the rhythm and takes the motif into higher spheres: Third statement of the Imperial March theme: Your browser does not support the audio element. But then - this is incredibly important - it comes back . After another repetition of the third statement, story arch finally gets closed in the fourth and final statement. The listener understands that the sentence is now over. And they are ready to learn how the story continues. Fourth statement of the Imperial March theme: Your browser does not support the audio element. The Imperial March is a textbook example of how to turn a simple motif into a powerful melody. Establish your motif and repeat it. Then, create a variation , and move it into a new place. Finally, come back . Burn this concept into your memory, and I guarantee you that you'll start noticing it in your favorite music, orchestral or not. Music is sonic storytelling. A good story establishes a character and setting, sends them on a journey, and skillfully hints at familiar elements that hold the story arch together. You've envisioned a concept for your song. Now, write a melody that tells a story worthy of your vision! Here's our example motif turned into a storytelling melody that presents itself, reinforces its idea, then travels to a new place, and comes back: Example motif (full melody): Your browser does not support the audio element. Note how the last 5 notes have exactly the same rhythm as the first 5 notes, bringing the melody home. Find chords for your melody Next, we have to find harmonies for our simple melody . This step is crucial because the harmonies carry large parts of our track's atmosphere. The same melody can be used in arrangements with completely different chord progressions for a vast range of emotions and atmospheres. You can interpret the first note of the melody as the root note and your first starting chord. For example, if the first melody note is a C, you might go with a C major or C minor chord . But you can also interpret the second note of the melody as the root note, with the first note simply leading towards it. The possibilities are endless! This is great but also scary for beginners. As a solid start, try finding the root note and home key. It helps you decide what chords belong in your song and how they should sound when played together. In my example motif, the first two notes are E and G, strongly indicating C major because C major includes both an E and a G. Once you've determined your key center (e.g. C major), look at all the notes in that key (e.g. C, D, E, F, G, A, and B in the C major key) and experiment. Which notes sound good with each other in the context of your melody? Then, try out different chords that contain these notes you liked. Those will then be the possible choices for a chord progression. If you like the note B as a harmony for the third note of your melody, you can try a B major chord (B-D#-F#). Or a G major (G-B-D). Or an E minor (E-G-B) chord. They all contain a B note , making them good contenders. You can do the same for every note in the scale that you think fits well. You don't have to use all of these possible chords; many songs only use three or four different chords throughout their entire length! Hello, pop music. Once you've established your home key, you can now look at scales that contain the notes of your melody. Or - if you're not that experienced with scales yet - simply look at which chords have several notes from your melody. Chances are high that these chords will fit the melody well. Tip: The most signature chord change in epic cinematic music is going from a minor chord to its relative major (3 half steps down, e.g. A minor to F major). Here is an example chord progression for our melody. Example motif (with chord progression): Your browser does not support the audio element. A finalized piano sketch with a melody, harmony, bass line, rhythm and decoration can sound like this. Example motif (full piano sketch): Your browser does not support the audio element. Next, all we have to do is assign instruments to the different parts. Record the melody with your violins and perhaps double it with flutes. Play in the bass line with double basses and a tuba. Add harmony with oboes, violas, and maybe even a full-string patch in the background as a harmonic bed. And glockenspiel and piccolo flutes can add sparkling decorations . These are just examples. And the possibilities are vast, too vast to cover in this chapter in detail. As always, try to keep it simple. You've already thought out all elements of your track in the piano track. Stay with them, and don't add unnecessary stuff. More often than not will, additional elements just complicate your arrangement. This is the most important message I have for you, and I'd be happy if it helps you when writing your first song. Here's a very rough, orchestrated version of our piano sketch . I simply assigned orchestral instruments to the 5 main aspects of our piece: Melody , Harmony , Bass , Rhythm , and Decoration . All elements are simply copied over from piano to an orchestral instrument. Example motif (orchestral): Your browser does not support the audio element.

Author: Kevin Kuschel Reading time: 5 mins Mixing and mastering are processes that improve the sound quality of your song. Both are art forms that take years and years to master (no pun intended!). There are dedicated mixing and mastering engineering professions. People dedicate their entire careers to making music productions sound the best way possible. Nowadays, more and more composers produce their own music from home without hiring a mixing or mastering engineer. In most cases, you'll be doing it yourself . Therefore, this chapter will introduce the basic steps in mixing and mastering. You'll get a rough idea of what you'll be doing when mixing and mastering your own first track. Table of Contents What is mixing vs. mastering? Preparing your MIDI: Timings, velocities, dynamics Mixing basics Mastering basics Conclusion What is mixing vs. mastering? Mixing is about balancing the levels and frequencies on an individual track level and then ensuring they all fit and sound well together. During the mixing stage, you adjust the volume faders so that all elements are audible the way you intend them (\"gain staging\"). Composers often use equalizers to fine-tune individual instruments by cutting or boosting specific frequencies. Other plugins can also be applied to shape the sound of individual tracks to taste (e.g. delay, compression, etc.). Mastering is the final step in creating your song or album. It involves making adjustments to the entire song on the master channel to make sure everything sounds consistent at a high level. The ultimate goal of mastering is to refine the composition and make it sound loud, clear, and polished. Although mixing and mastering are separate processes, especially in home productions, they often blend into one. Nowadays, mixing and mastering often go hand-in-hand with each other. Preparing your MIDI: Timings, velocities, dynamics Before we start mixing, you can do a few things to ensure your MIDI is in top shape. First, it's important to go track by track and inspect the timing and velocities of your MIDI notes . Solo one or a group of tracks and listen closely with the metronome activated to spot any timing inconsistencies. Some of the MIDI notes are off grid. Small timing imperfections can lead to a more realistic orchestral mockup, but make sure to double-check with the metronome to make sure they're not way out of time. Be especially mindful about sample delay, and make sure your instruments don't lag behind. Use your DAW's negative track delay or nudge the MIDI notes to compensate for it. We learned about this concept in the DAW chapter of the guide . Cinematic Studio Strings Cello spiccatos. Notes are on the grid, but too late because of the sample delay: Your browser does not support the audio element. Applied negative track delay. The notes are in time now: Your browser does not support the audio element. Next, you should check the velocity of each note , especially the tracks with short articulations. Are the accentuated notes emphasized correctly? Are the overall intensity levels okay? Adjust single notes or the entire line until it sounds about right. Tweak the velocities of your rhythmic short notes and make sure the accentuation makes sense. As a rule of thumb, emphasize notes that fall on the beat with higher velocity. Finally, before we get into mixing, ensure all your sustain and legato tracks have proper dynamics curves . Flute legato without dynamic curve: Your browser does not support the audio element. Flute legato with dynamic curve: Your browser does not support the audio element. Phrase melodies realistically, with swells and movement to make them sound convincing and evocative. Make your sustains and legatos sing by giving them dynamic curves using the mod wheel. Mixing basics Volume Balancing (\"Gain Staging\") Next, we want to balance the volume of each instrument. Many orchestral sample libraries already have great consistency, especially when using libraries from the same developer. In that case, you'll often do only minor volume adjustments or none because it was already done for you inside the library. But let's assume you're mixing libraries from different developers. Maybe it's a hybrid orchestral composition with synths and perhaps even a live recorded instrument such as a cello line. In these cases, volume balancing is necessary. With orchestral music, there can be up to 100 instrument tracks (or more!) which makes it hard to balance all tracks with each other. Instead, I suggest gain staging with the following steps: Solo one section only (e.g. your strings tracks violin 1, violin 2, violas, cellos, double basses) Play back (or loop ) a part of your composition where all instruments are playing Turn down their volume faders to 0 Our Strings section in the mixer, with all volume faders turned to 0. Now, turn up the volume of one instrument to a moderate level. You can start with the double basses, for example. Don't go to the full 0dB volume because we should leave some headroom for the mastering stage. Turn up the volume of the second instrument , e.g. the cellos, and balance them against the double basses. Continue with the other instruments of the section : the violas and violins, and fine-tune until your strings sound like a convincing section playing together in the same room. The strings instruments (violins 1, violins 2, violas, cellos and basses) are balanced against each other in volume. Once your strings section volume is balanced, do the same for the brass instruments. Now that you have two balanced sections, you can solo the strings and the brass folder buses and balance the sections against each other ,without adjusting the individual instruments. Next, balance the woodwind instrument tracks, and then solo the woodwinds bus to balance it against the strings and brass. You get the idea! :) At the end of this process, you should have an excellent volume balance throughout the entire orchestra, even if you used sample libraries from different developers recorded in different spaces. Compression Compression makes a track sound more consistent , louder , punchy , and controlled . A compressor levels out differences in volume between notes: Imagine your song as a waveform. I rendered the MIDI of my violin staccato melody to an audio track. It now shows the audio waveform. With compression, someone squishes the waveform between their hands, from the top and bottom sides. The loud parts become quieter, and the quiet parts become louder. It evens out the song, and there are fewer volume jumps. Same waveform after applying a compressor. The volume spikes are reduced in amplitude, the dynamics of the track have been \"compressed\". This explanation is very simplistic . There is a lot more you can do with compression, but because many beginner composers struggle to understand and utilize compressors, we will keep it basic for now. Percussion without compressor: Your browser does not support the audio element. Same percussion with compressor. The sound is slightly more controlled, glued together and energized: Your browser does not support the audio element. You can apply compression: on an individual instrument level to even out the dynamics e.g. in a solo violin performance on an orchestral section like the strings to make it sound more like a cohesive unit on the master level to even out the volume difference throughout the entire song. Equalization An equalizer (EQ) is one of the most essential tools for mixing and mastering music. It allows you to adjust the volume of each frequency band in an instrument track or the entire song. In orchestral music, EQs serve one crucial main function: Making space . Allowing the dozens of instruments to sit next to each other in the frequency spectrum without drowning each other out. Neutron Equalizer showing the sound information of a track from left (low frequencies) to right (high frequencies). The circles are nodes that can be adjusted to draw a frequency curve for the equalization effect. For example, you might want to remove the low frequencies of a violin. Violins are high instruments, but still, there will be a bit of rumble and noise in the low frequencies that can make your lower-pitched instruments, like cellos, sound less clear. High violins with lots of low-frequency noise and rumble: Your browser does not support the audio element. Removing noise with a low-cut filter makes the violins sound clearer: Your browser does not support the audio element. And since an orchestra has so many instruments, these frequencies will build up and lead to an overcrowded, \"muddy\" mix , where the instruments overlap and fight each other. Muddiness in the mix is one of the biggest challenges for most beginning orchestral producers. So, what can you do? There are many things. It's a complex problem that requires experience and good problem-solving skills. But one thing you can do is: Apply an EQ to each, or at least on your piece's most prominent, instruments. For high-pitched instruments like flutes, violins, or trumpets, apply a low-cut filter (or \"high-pass\" same thing, different name). Remove all frequencies to a certain point where it starts to influence the instrument's sound. You want to eliminate the inaudible noise but not change the instrument's sound. A low-cut filter (aka high-pass filter) applied to a violin melody. Low-cut filters reduce the frequency volume under a certain threshold. In orchestral music, applying a low-cut filter helps reduce noise and rumble that amplifies throughout the dozens of orchestral instruments You can also reduce the mids and higher frequencies for low-pitched instruments like double basses, tubas, or contrabassoons, when you want to give them more a bassy-percussive feel and reduce some of their tonal character. Be careful with this, because low instruments often contain large parts of their tonality in the mid (or even higher) frequencies. EQs can also boost or remove specific frequencies with precision . Imagine the EQ as a scalpel with which you can surgically remove harsh frequencies from an instrument. You may want to do this due to poor recording with actual noise in a particular frequency area or creatively shaping the instrument's sound. Space (Panning, Reverb, Delay) In music, and even more so when an orchestra is involved, it is necessary to space out instruments throughout the virtual stage to provide an exciting listening experience: Panning is used to placing sounds left and right in the stereo field. You can use it to add depth to your mix and make your music sound more immersive. It's also helpful in creating separation between instruments when you want to emphasize certain parts of the song. Listen to any of your favorite sounds with headphones. You will notice that some instruments or vocals come from the left and others from the right side of your head. Reverb is an effect that creates a sense of space by adding - well - reverb (a sort of hall effect) to a track. This can be useful when you want your music to seem recorded in a large space like a concert hall or church. This is particularly important with orchestral compositions usually recorded in larger halls. But even a short reverb for a studio-type of room helps make a track sound more realistic. No reverb: Your browser does not support the audio element. Reverb (Seventh Heaven): Your browser does not support the audio element. Orchestral libraries often come with internal reverbs. But when mixing several libraries with each other, it often makes sense to deactivate the internal reverb and add a third-party reverb that blends them together. Liquidsonics Seventh Heaven is a convolution reverb often used in orchestral music production. Delay creates echoes that bounce off surfaces such as walls or ceilings. You can use delay creatively to add atmosphere to your hybrid synths, vocals, or solo instruments. Feel free to experiment! There are a ton of other effects you can use for mixing. Some effects improve a track's overall tone and clarity (e.g. exciters or transient shapers). Others add creative nuances for a more interesting sound (e.g. distortion and filters). Mastering basics Mastering is the final stage in the production process and is applied to the master channel that affects all tracks of your song. It's where you take all your mixes, put them together, and make sure they sound good. Mastering can be done at any point during the production process. Still, it's generally best to wait until after everything else is done and then go back and master everything. Like mixing, mastering often uses EQ and compression to ensure that everything sounds nice and tidy and that the overall volume level is consistent throughout the song or album. Full orchestra (unmastered): Your browser does not support the audio element. Full orchestra (mastered): Your browser does not support the audio element. It's like leveling all your bookshelves at home: no matter which book you pick up, it'll all be at eye level, not too high or too low. Imagine people come over and have something to read while they're waiting for you to finish your monologue about that exciting last sample library purchase. They'll be able to pick up a book and read it without having to adjust the height of their nose to see what's written on the page. Mastering also takes care of the overall stereo balance of your track, meaning how far the sound spreads between the left and right stereo signals. Lastly, a limiter is an essential tool for mastering. Limiters boost the volume of your song without clipping or distorting the sound. This will make your song sound fuller and more professional. Mixing balances and adjusts individual tracks and buses. Mastering is applied to the entire song. Conclusion Mixing and mastering are not the same, but they are often done together. Mixing is the process of balancing each track to make sure all tracks sound great together and that there's no unwanted noise or distortion. Mastering is what happens after you've finished mixing all your songs. It usually involves adjusting levels, EQ settings, and effects settings until it sounds perfect for distribution or streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music. Congratulations!

Templates are great because they do this for yourself, giving you a solid foundation. You can create variations of your template to fit different projects. Perhaps your epic template can eliminate the woodwinds and world instrument section and add a trailer effects folder instead. You can then switch templates based on the needs of your project. There’s another benefit to building a template as a beginner. By creating tracks, folders, buses, and organizing and routing them, you’ll get good practice in navigating your DAW in a way that works for you. Of course you can also use templates that are not created by yourself. I bought two orchestral templates for my DAW Studio One when I started my composer journey. But - to be entirely honest - I never used them. It felt like working in someone else’s environment. Like entering a stranger’s home and trying to find the toilet (in the dark!). Instead, I spent a few days diving into the ins and outs of Studio One and made one myself. Youtube tutorials, composer community groups, and a good portion of trial and error finally made it click. After several projects full of clicking in the wrong places and being lost in menus and dialog windows, for the first time, I felt in control . That feeling of general cluelessness had finally vanished. It was so worth it. Because I made that experience earlier on my composer journey, I am convinced now that building your template from scratch is fantastic. No matter if you’ll end up using it a lot or not. However: Don’t feel forced to use a template just because many composers do. Instead, try to constantly evaluate your workflows and find shortcuts to accelerate your most frequently used actions inside the DAW. Find out yourself if a template helps you achieve this, or if you can find a better way. One example that works for me very well is creating modular blocks of track presets that I can drag into my project as I need them. Template structure Your template is your home . And unlike me using someone else’s template in the beginning, you’ll know where the toilet is. I’m not saying these are the correct way of doing things. Take it with a grain of salt and tailor things to your preference and workflow. You might even get ideas from using foreign templates for your own. First, here's how I structure my orchestral template in the big picture: Create a folder for the instrument section (\"STRINGS\" in this example) and add folders of all your strings libraries (\"CSS\", \"SCS\"). In each library folder, then add the instrument patches (\"VIOLINS 1\", \"VIOLINS 2\", \"VIOLAS\", \"CELLI\", \"DOUBLE BASSES\") The instrument sections are on the highest hierarchy level: Strings, Brass, Woodwinds, Percussion, etc. To each of these, we’ll add subfolders of sample libraries : Cinematic Studio Strings, Berlin Strings, Pacific Ensemble Strings, etc. And in each of those library folders, we’ll place the instrument patches we want: Violins 1, Violins 2, Violas, Cellos, Basses, etc. Organizing folders by sample library makes it easy for us to hide and deactivate library folders that we won’t need for a specific project. This helps us get a better overview of our project. Tip: You can also do it the other way round: First the instrument groups (Strings, Brass…), then instrument folders (e.g. Violin 1, Violin 2,...) and inside each of those instrument folders the respective sample library patches (Violin 1 CSS, Violin 1 Berlin Strings, Violin 1 Pacific Strings). Here are some of my personal preferences regarding orchestral templates and DAW workflows. Some of these spark rather hot debates among composers :) Find a workflow in your DAW that works fast and reliable for you. My findings are based on years of deliberate work, mistakes, trial and error, and ultimately: improvement. Feel free to get inspired and try adopting them to your own routine when composing. Multi vs. single patches I prefer using multi-patches (all articulations in one patch) over individual single-instrument patches (e.g. only staccato articulation). That way, I can switch articulations quickly and on the fly, using either keyswitches or - much more convenient - Studio One's Sound Variations/Cubase's Expression Maps or other articulation mapping features. Kontakt routing Some people add multiple instruments into the same Kontakt instance and use the MIDI channel to route them to several tracks in your template. Honestly, this is too complicated for me. I add only one instrument patch per Kontakt instance to save myself routing trouble with multiple Kontakt output channels. It doesn’t seem much more taxing on the CPU and feels more intuitive to me. I want to go for simplicity here. Purging If my computer has less than 64GB of RAM, I will purge all Kontakt instances in my template to save RAM and have a clean and lightweight start. If I have 64GB or more I don’t bother purging, because my system can load everything. Reverb: Inserts vs. sends You can add your reverb plugin as an insert effect directly on the tracks (or a folder bus) you want to apply it to, and set it according to the desired effect. Alternatively , you can create an effects channel with your reverb set to 100%, then route all your instrument tracks to the channel with different signal strengths. That way, you can achieve different amounts of reverb for each instrument or section with only one reverb insert for your CPU to process. I use one reverb insert effect for each instrument section , sometimes even just one reverb plugin on the master fader that applies to the entire project. One reverb insert per orchestral section (strings, brass, etc.) still gives enough fine control to reach the sound of a pro-level virtual orchestra. I guess I just don’t like routing things. Focusing on simplicity and modularity, let’s build our template. Build your template in 10 simple steps Disclaimer : This process gets a bit technical, but it's something you need to I documented the step-by-step process in a 5-minute video tutorial , which will be easier to follow. In any case, here's the written explanation with screenshots. I use Studio One, and it will work similarly with other DAWs. When building our orchestral template, we’ll work backward from sample library patch (e.g. Violin 1) to sample library subfolder (e.g. Cinematic Studio Strings) to instrument section folder (e.g. Strings). 1. Create a new project . Create a new project, give it a name and press OK. 2. Add Kontakt instances . Let’s start with the strings section. In Studio One, simply drag and drop the Kontakt instrument from the browser onto your empty track list. It will automatically create an instrument track with a loaded Kontakt instance. 3. Select the sample library patches you want and load them into each Kontakt instance. Ensure that each Kontakt instance's internal reverb is turned off if you plan to use an external reverb plugin. Purge all instruments if your computer has less than 64GB of RAM to be on the safe side when loading up your template. Load all sample library patches of your instrument group and adjust the settings to your liking. I deactivated the internal reverb and purged the samples to save RAM. 4. Name the tracks (e.g. VIOLINS 1, VIOLINS 2, VIOLAS, etc.) and pack them into a folder. 5. Name the folder according to your library (e.g. CINEMATIC STUDIO STRINGS). 6. Set the negative track delay for each track according to the sample delay of your library. I’d pick -60ms for CSS because that’s the sample delay for its shorts articulations. The legato timings I will manually adjust when recording melodies. I set the track delay of my Cinematic Studio Strings tracks to -60ms to compensate for CSS' 60ms delay on their short articulations. 7. (optional): If you have them, you can apply Expression maps (Cubase) or Sound Variations (Studio One) to each patch for quick articulation switching. I purchased Babylonwaves Art Conductor that comes with thousands of these pre-mapped articulation switches. In the beginning, I hesitated if it's worth the ca. $100 Dollar investment. But I quickly understood: For me, there's no turning back! It's just so nice not having to worry about keyswitching. I mapped the most important articulations to a button on my Stream Deck, and can switch articulations pretty much seamlessly. Tip: With s1toolbox.com by Lukas Ruschitzka, you can convert Cubase Expression Maps into Studio One Sound Variations with one click. For free. Now we have a library folder (in our case Cinematic Studio Strings) within our Strings folder that has all patches prepared with no internal reverb, purged RAM, a negative track delay, and active Sound Variations. If you have another strings library, you can do the same drill. Prepare the patches in the way you like them, don’t forget to set the correct negative track delay and pack them in a folder. You now have two strings library folders inside the strings folder. Each contains patches for violins, violas, cellos, and basses. Depending on your next project, you can hide the strings library folder you don’t want to use. 8. Once you have all strings patches prepared and organized, select them and add a bus channel . Place your reverb as an insert on this bus channel. It will now be applied to all patches inside the Strings folder. For me, one reverb per section (strings, brass, etc.) is enough, and - IF I wanted - I could still make fine adjustments on an individual patch level or add one reverb bus per library. But for now, I won’t. Drag and drop your favorite Reverb from the Browser onto the new Strings bus. It will be applied to all tracks in that bus (\"VIOLINS 1\", \"VIOLINS 2\", \"VIOLAS\", \"CELLOS\", \"BASSES\"). 9. Repeat the same steps for the Brass section, Woodwinds, Percussion, Vocals, Sound Design, and whatever you want to add to your template. And at the end, it will look something like this. The final folder and patch structure: All instrument groups (\"STRINGS\", \"BRASS\", \"WOODWINDS\", \"PERCUSSION\", \"SOUND DESIGN\") have their sample library folders (\"CINEMATIC STUDIO STRINGS\", \"DAMAGE 2\", etc.), which have their instrument patches (\"TRUMPETS\", \"FRENCH HORNS\", etc.). Each instrument group folder has a bus channel that can host effects like reverb. You can click on any track - like the Flutes in this example - and immediately play the correct instrument. You can open , close , and hide folders and immediately access all your instruments. With Expression Maps (Cubase) or Sound Variations (Studio One), you can switch between articulations in the same patch and even assign them to buttons on your keyboard. Good preparation pays off here. 10. Lastly, add a simple mastering chain if you have plugins for that already. A mastering compressor (e.g. Shadow Hills Mastering Compressor ) and limiter would be great here. I added a number of mastering plugins to the master channel: The Shadow Hills Mastering Compressor, Slate Digital's Fresh Air, Izotope Ozone 10, Sonnox Oxford Inflator and LEVELS by Mastering The Mix. These effects apply to the entire audio signal. If you wanted, you could add EQ inserts to instruments that you wish to adjust in their sound frequencies. For example, if you don’t like the warm tone of your CSS violins, you might already add brightness to them as part of the template. Personally, I’d do this later on in the mixing and mastering stage. Dragging and dropping an instance of Pro EQ as an insert effect from the Browser directly onto a track You now got the main framework for your new template by focusing on simplicity and modularity. You can easily add library folders to your instrument group buses or add entirely new groups to the template, like synths or world instruments.
