When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load. As the Trump administration seeks to remake the immigration system and deports tens of thousands of people, many immigrants are more scared about living in the United States, and yet their resolve to remain here is largely unchanged. A new national survey of immigrants in the country — both documented and undocumented, and varying widely in how and when they arrived — found that about half of all immigrants say they feel less safe since President Trump took office. The survey was done by The New York Times and KFF, a nonprofit that conducts polling and research about health policy. Among the immigrants surveyed — whether they are here legally or not, or have been naturalized as citizens — concern that they or a family member could be detained or deported has risen significantly since before Mr. Trump’s return to power. Still, large majorities also say their own future, and that of their children, remains bright, with the concept of the American dream retaining its powerful appeal. About 70 percent said that if they could go back in time, they would still make the choice to migrate to the United States. The survey captured a snapshot of immigrant life against a backdrop of enormous change in the United States, with many people standing by their choice to come — sometimes illegally — even as their image of the country as a welcoming place has been shaken. Immigrants feel that, across every measure, they are better off in the United States compared with the living conditions that propelled them to leave their homelands. The survey, of 1,805 immigrants across the country, is a broad look at a group for which there is often very little data to understand their views and experiences, given that the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask specifics about immigration status. The group is also a small share of the population and too difficult to reach to be measured with accuracy by most surveys. Who are U.S. immigrants?

As the Trump administration seeks to remake the immigration system and deports tens of thousands of people, many immigrants are more scared about living in the United States, and yet their resolve to remain here is largely unchanged. A new national survey of immigrants in the country — both documented and undocumented, and varying widely in how and when they arrived — found that about half of all immigrants say they feel less safe since President Trump took office. The survey was done by The New York Times and KFF, a nonprofit that conducts polling and research about health policy. Among the immigrants surveyed — whether they are here legally or not, or have been naturalized as citizens — concern that they or a family member could be detained or deported has risen significantly since before Mr. Trump’s return to power. Still, large majorities also say their own future, and that of their children, remains bright, with the concept of the American dream retaining its powerful appeal. About 70 percent said that if they could go back in time, they would still make the choice to migrate to the United States. The survey captured a snapshot of immigrant life against a backdrop of enormous change in the United States, with many people standing by their choice to come — sometimes illegally — even as their image of the country as a welcoming place has been shaken. Immigrants feel that, across every measure, they are better off in the United States compared with the living conditions that propelled them to leave their homelands. The survey, of 1,805 immigrants across the country, is a broad look at a group for which there is often very little data to understand their views and experiences, given that the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask specifics about immigration status. The group is also a small share of the population and too difficult to reach to be measured with accuracy by most surveys. Who are U.S. immigrants?

              "content": "About Contact Featured Latest What I Cover I write about immigration in the New York region. I spend most of my time covering the city’s diverse immigrant communities, and exploring the effect government policies have on documented and undocumented immigrants in New York. I covered the influx of migrants who began arriving in New York under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and spent eight months documenting life inside the city’s shelter system for migrants. I also traveled to the Mexican and Canadian borders to chronicle their journeys. Since 2025, I have covered the ways in which President Trump has tackled immigration enforcement. I have written about the spike in arrests in New York, the government’s shifting tactics, their impact on immigrant neighborhoods and one man’s deportation to Jamaica from New York. I often rely on my native Spanish skills — I’m from Puerto Rico — and my modest French to communicate with the immigrants I meet. My favorite stories are human ones that surprise readers or demystify complex immigration issues — sometimes both at the same time. My Background I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where I studied political science, economics and philosophy, but spent most of my time cultivating my love for journalism at the student newspaper and The Philadelphia Inquirer. I joined The Times in 2017 as a summer intern on the Metro section before I was hired full time and assigned to cover housing. I later became Albany bureau chief, leading coverage of New York State politics and government in the State Capitol. I chronicled Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and the scandals that led to his resignation and the rise of Gov. Kathy Hochul. I began covering immigration in December 2023. My immigration reporting has received awards from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and the Silurians Press Club. In 2025, I was a finalist for the Livingston Awards. Journalistic Ethics My goal when reporting a story is to be relentlessly curious. That means exploring all the possible perspectives of a story, and reporting it deeply, accurately and transparently. I believe in providing readers with context, lots of it. And I seek to treat the people I write about fairly, with empathy and humility. I reach conclusions only after the fact-finding process leads me to them. I always identify myself as a Times reporter when talking to people. I do not accept gifts, money or favors from anyone who might figure into my reporting. Nor do I provide monetary aid or gifts to the people I cover. I do not participate in political causes, nor do I make political donations. You can learn more about The Times’s ethics policy here .

              "content": "About Contact Latest What I Cover My primary responsibility is working on The New York Times/Siena College Poll . I lead the development of the questions we ask voters, then analyze and report on the poll’s findings. Much of our work is focused on understanding how voters feel about upcoming elections, but we also probe the underlying issues driving these attitudes, capturing views across the political and demographic spectrum. You can read more here about how The Times/Siena Poll works and submit your own questions to our team. I also write about public opinion more broadly in the United States, looking at how attitudes about key social issues have shifted over time and how major news events impact those views. My Background I have worked in survey research for 17 years. I joined The Times in 2022, right as the midterm elections were heating up. I previously worked for nearly a decade at the Pew Research Center. At Pew, I helped lead research that used registered voter lists to achieve a better understanding of who voted in each election and which candidates they preferred. I also did research on interpreting the models we use to predict who is likely to vote. Additionally, I conducted dozens of surveys to measure Americans’ views on hot-button issues from guns to gender to the workplace. I graduated from University of Maryland and have a master’s from Carnegie Mellon University. Journalistic Ethics I believe that public opinion polling helps ensure that the voices of all Americans are heard, and I strive to remain politically neutral in order to best understand and reflect those voters’ voices. In an effort to stay as open-minded and fair as possible, and in keeping with The Times’s rigorous ethics guidelines , I do not participate in political causes or advocate for candidates or issues, even in private settings, and I do not make political donations. I do not accept gifts, money or favors. I also strive to be as transparent as possible about how The Times conducts its polling. I am the co-chair of the American Association of Public Opinion Researchers’ Transparency Initiative , which promotes and encourages transparency in survey research.

I’m lucky to do this from New York, which has the country’s largest immigrant population. I am fascinated by the ways in which the city’s myriad cultures clash and coalesce. A big part of my job involves talking with immigrants and their neighbors to learn how politics affects their lives, and how they, in turn, are shaping the way that the government is run. My Background I’m an immigrant myself and know these issues well. I was born in Reynosa, Mexico and raised on the southern border in Texas. I am a native Spanish speaker and learned basic French in Bordeaux. Before joining The Times in 2021, I worked as a beat reporter at five newspapers across the country. Over the course of almost two decades, I have chased cartel gunfights south of the Mexican border, written about celebrity crimes in Las Vegas and investigated predatory tolling practices in Virginia. I was a Livingston Award finalist in 2021 while I was a reporter for The Virginian-Pilot. The next year, I was part of a team that was a Pulitzer finalist for stories about New York’s deadliest fire in decades , and in 2023, I traveled to Chicago to report for Hannah Dreier’s Pulitzer-winning series about migrant child labor . Journalistic Ethics The Times has strict ethical standards that I follow. I work hard to be accurate and fair. I am equally meticulous in protecting my sources. I do not accept gifts, money or favors from anyone who might figure into my reporting. I make every effort to understand issues from multiple angles.

          "description": "Recent changes to the CDC’s website language falsely asserting that a link between vaccines and autism cannot be ruled out may introduce ambiguity that online narratives can exploit.",
          "content": "Home Quick Takes Previous Changes to Public Charge Regulations Will Likely Lead More Immigrant Families to Avoid Health Care and Assistance Programs For decades, scientific consensus has held that vaccines do not cause autism, but KFF polling and media monitoring show that uncertainty remains widespread. Recent changes to the CDC’s website language falsely asserting that a link between vaccines and autism cannot be ruled out may introduce ambiguity that online narratives can exploit. Most people are not firmly entrenched in false beliefs but remain uncertain. KFF Health Information and Trust tracking polls find high exposure to the autism myth and low certainty about its accuracy. As of April, 63% of adults and 61% of parents had heard the claim that MMR vaccines have been proven to cause autism, but fewer than 5% say it is “definitely true.” Most fall into the “muddled middle,” saying this claim is “probably true” or “probably false.” This uncertainty matters: the same poll found parents who endorse false claims are twice as likely to delay or skip vaccines compared to those who view these claims as false. Partisan and demographic divides exist, with Republican parents and those without a college degree more likely to express doubt or lean toward believing the claim. After news of the CDC’s language change broke, there was a surge of online reactions on social media that both celebrated and criticized the change, indicating persistent mixed beliefs among the public. Ongoing media monitoring suggests that when official guidance changes, online narratives frame it as proof that prior statements were “lies,” potentially contributing to uncertainty and deepening skepticism. Taken together, these findings illustrate how uncertainty about vaccines and autism persists even after decades of research, and how shifts in official language can interact with that uncertainty. Polling shows most people are not firmly committed to false beliefs but remain unsure. At the same time, media monitoring suggests that changes in guidance often become focal points for online narratives framing prior statements as misleading. This combination of high exposure and low certainty may pose a challenge for communicators when scientific consensus meets changing institutional messaging, and possibly contribute to fewer children getting vaccinated against deadly childhood diseases.",

Ben Hendren/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Ben Hendren/Bloomberg via Getty Images The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made a dramatic about-face in the agency's position on the relationship between vaccines and autism. The CDC's website now says a link between vaccines and autism cannot be ruled out . That's a reversal from the CDC's longstanding stance that there is no link. The change comes even though a connection between vaccines and autism has long been debunked by a large body of high-quality research. But Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long promoted the discredited claim . The CDC's change is alarming public health experts. They are already worried about a drop in childhood vaccination, which has led to a resurgence of dangerous childhood diseases like measles and whooping cough. \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has been changed to promote false information suggesting vaccines cause autism,\" said Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement. \"Since 1998, independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people. The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There's no link between vaccines and autism.\" She went on to say, \"Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents. We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.\" In a statement to NPR, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon repeated one of the changes to the website: \"The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.\" He said the department \"has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\" \"The new statement shows a lack of understanding of the term 'evidence,'\" the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement the organization provided to NPR, adding, \"No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines.\" It's a statement that's confusing by design, said Dr. Paul Offitt , a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"These are the usual anti-vaccine tropes, misrepresentation of studies, false equivalence,\" he says. \"They might as well say chicken nuggets might cause autism because you can't prove that either.\" The changes on the website \"blindsided\" career scientists at CDC, says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former top CDC official who resigned from the agency in August. \"The scientists did not participate in its creation,\" he says. \"And the data are unvetted.\" Two current CDC staffers, who contacted NPR Thursday, say the updates are a glaring red flag that indicate the vaccine information on the agency website is no longer credible, and is instead \"anti-science.\" They requested anonymity out of concern they could lose their jobs for speaking to the press. The moves are the latest in a series of steps Kennedy has taken on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines that run counter to mainstream medical and scientific organizations like the pediatrics academy, the Infectious Disease Society of American and the American College of Physicians. Vaccine proponents say the moves are recklessly undermining public confidence in vaccines and fueling vaccine hesitancy, putting the nation's children at risk. The U.S. appears to be poised to lose its status as having eliminated measles . Kennedy sacked all the members of the CDC's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, earlier this year and replaced the members with his own slate. In one of its first actions, the new advisory committee called for the removal of the preservative thimerosal used in a small fraction of flu vaccines, even though safety concerns about it have also been debunked. Under Kennedy, federal health agencies have also made it harder for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and canceled grants funding new vaccines that rely on mRNA technology at the heart of the most used COVID vaccines. The Trump administration has also claimed there is a link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and autism, and promoted the use of leucovorin, a prescription form of vitamin B9, to treat autism even though the evidence supporting that is scant . An ACIP working group is now studying more major changes in childhood vaccinations, including removing compounds that include aluminum used to increase vaccine effectiveness . These adjuvants have been used safely for nearly a century. The committee is also exploring separating a single shot now given to protect against measles, mumps and rubella in a single shot into individual shots. Public health experts say both moves are scientifically unsound and would essentially upend the nation's childhood vaccination regimen, leaving children vulnerable to diseases that had long been brought under control. The committee is also considering recommending delaying vaccinating children against hepatitis B . For years, all babies have been vaccinated against hepatitis at birth. Hepatitis B can cause liver failure and liver cancer. The CDC acknowledges in a footnote on its main webpage on autism and vaccines that it still carries a header reading \"Vaccines do not cause autism*\" and says it hasn't \"been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.\" NPR emailed Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy's office for comment but didn't receive an immediate response. Cassidy chairs the Senate HELP Committee, which vetted Kennedy's nomination to lead HHS and voted along party lines to support it. Cassidy posted on X Thursday afternoon : \"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases. What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\" vaccine side effects CDC autism immunizations children's health",

              "content": "Autism and Vaccines Nov. 19, 2025 The claim \"vaccines do not cause autism\" is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism. Studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities. HHS has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links. Vaccines do not cause Autism* Pursuant to the Data Quality Act (DQA), which requires federal agencies to ensure the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information they disseminate to the public, this webpage has been updated because the statement \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" is not an evidence-based claim. Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism. However, this statement has historically been disseminated by the CDC and other federal health agencies within HHS to prevent vaccine hesitancy. HHS has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links. This webpage will be updated with gold-standard science that results from the HHS comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism as required by the DQA. The following, as required by the DQA, details the state of the evidence and studies, and the lack thereof, regarding vaccines and autism spectrum disorder (autism) and outlines HHS future research directions to provide answers. Background It is critical to address questions the American people have about the cause of autism to ensure public health guidance is adequately responsive to their concerns. Approximately one in two surveyed parents of autistic children believe vaccines played a role in their child's autism, often pointing to the vaccines their child received in the first six months of life (Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTaP), Hepatitis B (HepB), Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), Poliovirus, inactivated (IPV), and Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV)) and one given at or after the first year of life (Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)). This connection has not been properly and thoroughly studied by the scientific community. In 1986, the CDC's childhood immunization schedule for infants (≤ 1 year of age) recommended five total doses of vaccines: two oral doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and three injected doses of Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Pertussis Vaccine (DTP). In 2025, the CDC schedule recommended three oral doses of Rotavirus (RV) and three injected doses each of HepB, DTaP, Hib, PCV, and IPV by six months of age, two injected doses of Influenza (IIV) by 7 months of age, and injected doses of Hib, PCV, MMR, Varicella (VAR), and Hepatitis A (HepA) at 12 months of age. The rise in autism prevalence since the 1980s correlates with the rise in the number of vaccines given to infants. Though the cause of autism is likely to be multi-factorial, the scientific foundation to rule out one potential contributor entirely has not been established. For example, one study found that aluminum adjuvants in vaccines had the highest statistical correlation with the rise in autism prevalence among numerous suspected environmental causes. Correlation does not prove causation, but it does merit further study. State of the Evidence: Infant Vaccines - DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, PCV The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 required that \"the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall complete a review of all relevant medical and scientific information ... on the nature, circumstances, and extent of the relationship, if any, between vaccines containing pertussis ... and the following illnesses and conditions.\" The statute lists 11 specific illnesses and conditions, including autism. Since then, multiple reports from HHS and the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine have examined the links between autism and vaccines. These reviews have consistently concluded that there are still no studies that support the specific claim that the infant vaccines, DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, and PCV, do not cause autism and hence the CDC was in violation of the DQA when it claimed, \"vaccines do not cause autism.\" CDC is now correcting the statement, and HHS is providing appropriate funding and support for studies related to infant vaccines and autism. Below is a brief timeline and summary of the key findings related to the 1986 directive from Congress regarding the pertussis vaccine and autism. Of note, the 2014 AHRQ review also addressed the HepB vaccine and autism. One cross-sectional study met criteria for reliability; it found a threefold risk of parental report of autism among newborns receiving a HepB vaccine in the first month of life compared to those who did not receive this vaccine or did so after the first month. After reviewing the study, AHRQ determined that there was insufficient evidence of an association of the HepB vaccine and autism. In fact, there are still no studies that support the claim that any of the 20 doses of the seven infant vaccines recommended for American children before the first year of life do not cause autism. These vaccines include DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, PCV, rotavirus, and influenza. State of the Evidence: MMR Vaccine The MMR vaccine has been studied regarding autism, and the reviews from IOM and AHRQ maintain with a high strength of evidence that there is no association with autism spectrum disorders based on observational evidence only. However, in 2012, the IOM reviewed the published MMR-autism studies and found that all but four of them had \"serious methodological limitations,\" and the IOM gave them no weight. The remaining four studies and a few similar studies published since also have all been criticized for serious methodological flaws. Furthermore, they are all retrospective epidemiological studies which cannot prove causation, fail to account for potential vulnerable subgroups, and fail to account for mechanistic and other evidence linking vaccines with autism. Many of the retrospective studies utilized, such as the 2002 New England Journal of Medicine study on the Denmark population, may be unreliable for the U.S. population. Children in these studies receive vaccines based on foreign vaccination schedules that differ from the schedule in the U.S. As outlined in the 2013 IOM report on the childhood immunization schedule, \"there are few comparative studies evaluating the safety of different vaccine schedules,\" but \"there are cases in which the risk of adverse events can depend on the vaccination schedule used and factors such as timing and adjuvants should be studied with appropriate design methods.\" For example, the MMR vaccine does not contain aluminum. However, other infant vaccines have aluminum content ranging from 0.25 mg to 0.625 mg per dose (DTaP has the highest content). One analysis found that the 2019 CDC vaccine schedule resulted in 4.925 mg of total vaccine-related aluminum exposure by age 18 months. There is evidence in the U.S. of a positive association between vaccine-related aluminum exposure and persistent asthma. Evidence from a large Danish cohort study reported no increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders with early childhood exposure to aluminum-adsorbed vaccines, but a detailed review of the supplementary tables shows some higher event rates of neurodevelopmental conditions with moderate aluminum exposure (Supplement Figure 11 — though a dose response was not evident) and a statistically significant 67% increased risk of Asperger's syndrome per 1 mg increase in aluminum exposure among children born between 2007 and 2018 (Supplement Figure 4). Together, these findings warrant further investigation of aluminum exposures (high, low, and none) for a variety of childhood chronic diseases, including autism. HHS Research on Plausible Biologic Mechanisms between Vaccines and Autism HHS will evaluate plausible biologic mechanisms between early childhood vaccinations and autism. Mechanisms for further investigation include the impacts of aluminum adjuvants, risks for certain children with mitochondrial disorders, harms of neuroinflammation, and more. * The header \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.

          "content": "Home Quick Takes Previous ACA Insurers Are Raising Premiums by an Estimated 26%, but Most Enrollees Could See Sharper Increases in What They Pay We had the first glimpse of how the congressional debate in Washington over the federal shutdown and extending the enhanced premium tax credits for people who purchase coverage on the ACA marketplaces may be impacting voters’ decisions in upcoming elections last night. Looking at the 2025 Voter Poll results from Virginia and New Jersey, the economy remains the top issue for voters (48% of voters in Virginia said it was the most important issue facing the state as did 32% of New Jersey voters), health care came in behind economic issues with about one in five voters saying it was their most important issue. And this group of voters went disproportionately for the Democratic candidates. For example, in Virginia, the Democratic candidate for Governor won 81% of voters who said health care was the most important issue facing the state. The only group that the Republican candidate did as well with was the 11% of voters who said immigration was their top issue. In New Jersey, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill won 92% of health care voters . Notably, both Democratic candidates for Governor also won a majority of voters who said the economy was their most important issue – a group that President Trump won handedly back in 2024 . After Tuesday’s elections, it is becoming increasingly difficult to disentangle concerns about the economy and concerns about health care as costs become the most pressing health care issue for voters, as CEO Drew Altman and I have both argued in the past. There are many caveats and cautions before predicting how this off-year election and the current debate and government shutdown will play out a year from now including the fact that these election results are limited to two states and elections are often more about specific candidates than actually about issues. In addition, if there is a deal on the ACA tax credits, it will no longer serve as a talking point for candidates. However, the results do underscore the advantage that Democratic candidates still have on health care issues. And as economic issues and health care concerns become even more intertwined, as seen in the debate over the ACA tax credits in Washington, voters may give the upper hand to Democratic candidates in the voting booth. The 2025 election results highlight the growing importance of addressing health care costs in both policy debates and electoral choices.

          "content": "Home Quick Takes Previous Which Congressional Districts Could See the Greatest ACA Premium Payment Increases? The Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits have taken center stage this week as lawmakers debate extending these benefits as part of the negotiations about the federal budget. At a time when so much about our country’s health care system, and really most issues in this country, is viewed through a partisan lens, one of the more striking findings from the most recent KFF Health Tracking Poll was the bipartisan support for Congress extending these tax credits for people who buy their own coverage. But perhaps it isn’t surprising when you think about these tax credits less as an extension of President Obama’s landmark 2010 health reform law and more through the lens of health care costs. Views of the 2010 ACA are still largely partisan with large majorities of Democrats continuing to view the law favorably while two-thirds of Republicans hold unfavorable views of the legislation. Yet, at the same time, majorities of Democrats (92%) and Republicans (59%) think Congress should extend these expiring tax credits. This includes a majority of the most ardent base of Republican lawmakers – supporters of the MAGA movement, 57% of whom say they want to see the tax credits extended. For some, these two polling results might seem to contradict each other. Why would Republicans support a key component of how the ACA has expanded it’s reach in recent years? It may have to do with the fact that the thought of your health insurance premiums doubling is distressing, regardless of your party identification. We saw this play out with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene this week. Rep. Greene is an ardent opponent of the ACA but even she spoke out against the increasing cost of ACA premiums. Just under half of adults in the U.S. say it is difficult to afford their health care costs including about four in ten Republicans (41%) and Democrats (36%). In addition, the cost of health care frequently tops the list of things the public worries about affording with six in ten (62%) adults say they are either “very” or “somewhat” worried about being able to afford their health care. As Drew Altman pointed out, the impact of the loss of these enhanced tax credits will be especially hard for people living in red states without Medicaid expansion. And while most people wouldn’t be directly affected by the expiration of the enhanced ACA tax credits, even people who aren’t directly affected may have family members or friends who are, as Rep. Greene’s comments illustrate. Furthermore, the debate over extending these enhanced tax credits can be seen as a proxy for the broader public’s concerns about health care affordability which may be why the public is largely in favor of extending these subsidies – even as overall views of the ACA are still very polarized.

              "description": "Marjorie Taylor Greene doubled down on remarks about ObamaCare subsidies amid the government shutdown, saying health care premium spikes will be \"brutal\" and that Americans \"are going to be hurting.\"",
              "content": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) doubled down on recent remarks about Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies amid a government shutdown battle centered around health care. “The issues of the subsidies are real. It’s not something that anybody can say is made up,” Greene told NewsNation’s “The Hill” host Blake Burman. “Also, people with regular or private plans, their premiums are looking to go up a median of 18 percent. That’s brutal. I know a lot of small-business owners, like a family of four, and they’re paying $2,000 a month.” “If you double their health insurance, or even triple it, these people are going to — they’re either going to have to drop it, or they’re going to be choosing between rent and their insurance,” Greene later added. She also said she thinks Republicans “got to get real and actually come up with a solution.” “I’m literally here in Washington saying, you guys, if we don’t fix this right now, Americans are going to be hurting, and they really don’t care about R and D. They’re going to be talking about what’s happening to their bank accounts, what’s happening to their family, and that’s how they’re going to vote,” she told Burman. Greene on Monday indicated a willingness to negotiate with Democrats on health care demands. The Georgia Republican said she was “absolutely disgusted” that health insurance premiums could double in the case of ACA tax credits expiring “But I’m going to go against everyone on this issue because when the tax credits expire this year my own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district,” Greene wrote in a post on the social platform X. “No I’m not towing the party line on this, or playing loyalty games. I’m a Republican and won’t vote for illegals to have any tax payer funded healthcare or benefits,” she added. On Monday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) argued the end-of-year deadline to extend ACA subsidies was an “eternity” away. “We have effectively three months to negotiate. In the White House and in the halls of Congress, that’s like an eternity,” Johnson told MSNBC’s Ali Vitali. The subsidies were introduced amid the COVID-19 pandemic and extended through the end of 2025 via the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Open enrollment in most states begins Nov. 1, and insurers may raise premiums then if they believe the subsidies will expire.

Seniors and People with Disabilities More than 1 in 3 people with disabilities (15 million) have Medicaid (35%). In comparison, only 19% of people without disabilities have Medicaid. Children with Special Needs Amid debates about proposed cuts to federal Medicaid spending, this brief analyzes key characteristics of children with special health care needs and explores how Medicaid provides them with coverage. People With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Among the estimated 8 million people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD), over three million have Medicaid coverage. Adults with Chronic Conditions Among working age adults enrolled in Medicaid, approximately three quarters have one or more chronic conditions, and nearly one-third have three or more. 5 Facts: Immigrants and Medicaid This brief provides five key facts on Medicaid and immigrants as context for understanding the potential impacts of policy changes under the Trump administration. 5 Facts: Medicaid and Hospitals This brief explains the role of Medicaid for hospitals, including how much spending on hospital care comes from Medicaid, the share of births covered by the program, and how Medicaid expansion has impacted hospital finances. Medicaid Financing: The Basics Medicaid is a major source of financing for states to provide health coverage and long-term services and supports for low-income residents. This brief examines key questions about Medicaid financing and how it works. 5 Facts: Medicaid’s Share of National Health Spending This brief explores how Medicaid spending contributes to national health spending and how different service areas contribute to Medicaid costs. 5 Facts: Medicaid and Nursing Facilities The substantial Medicaid savings in the reconciliation bill could have major implications for nearly 15,000 federally certified nursing facilities and the 1.2 million people living in them.
