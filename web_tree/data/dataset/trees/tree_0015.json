      "content": "Virtual Second Opinions Learn More Get Started (U.S.) Call: 216.444.3223 An easy and fast way to help you make a more informed, confident decision about your care. All from the comfort of home. Without the cost or hassle of travel. Virtual Second Opinions (VSO) by Cleveland Clinic is delivered by The Clinic , a joint venture between Cleveland Clinic and Amwell, a global leader in telehealth. But what’s a virtual second opinion? A second opinion is a way to get more information about a condition, treatment option or procedure from an expert — and when it’s virtual, you can do it all without leaving home. No travel time, record-collecting, or hunting down the best specialists needed. With virtual second opinions, you’ll be more informed and equipped to move forward. 67% of virtual second opinions recommend a change in diagnosis or treatment plan. When Should I Consider a Second Opinion? A second opinion can be a good option when you’re: Diagnosed with a serious condition. Told you need to have surgery or a procedure. Considering a possibly risky treatment. Experiencing a condition is changing and possibly getting worse. Confused about or struggling with a medical challenge. How do Virtual Second Opinions by Cleveland Clinic Work? 1. Registration and live intake visit with a nurse care manager: After you create an account through our secure portal, you’ll have a live video visit with your nurse care manager (U.S. only). They'll take it from there and get you on your path to peace of mind. 2. Records collection and expedited matching: The next step is all about getting the information we need to help you. With your consent, we do all the work of collecting your medical records and then match you with a Cleveland Clinic specialist in just a few days. We make this possible weeks sooner than it might be in-person. 3. Expert second opinion: Your second opinion will be delivered in a written report and an optional virtual visit with the Cleveland Clinic provider (virtual visit not available in all locations). View more: View less: When you receive your VSO it’ll be in a written report outlining your expert provider’s recommendations. Depending on your location, you may have the option to include a virtual visit (video or phone) with the Cleveland Clinic provider to review those recommendations.

              "description": "See our list of frequently asked questions for more details about how to understand what is included in Cleveland Clinic hospital charge lists.",
              "content": "How much will I have to pay out of pocket? What you pay depends on a few things. If you have health insurance, you’re responsible for your deductible, copay and coinsurance (if your plan includes them). These amounts are set by your insurance company. You may not owe anything if: You’ve met your deductible for the year You’ve reached your out-of-pocket maximum You have secondary insurance that covers remaining costs Keep in mind: Costs can vary depending on whether your provider or hospital is in-network (contracted with your insurance) or out-of-network. Starting June 1, 2025, copays will be collected before or at check-in for appointments for nonemergency outpatient services, including scheduled office visits, diagnostic tests and procedures. This change isn’t meant to disrupt your care. If you have commercial insurance or Medicare Advantage and can’t pay your copay at the time of your visit, you can set up a 0% interest payment plan. Patient appointments won’t be canceled or rescheduled. This doesn’t apply to: Emergency care Surgeries or inpatient hospital stays Cancer treatments Urgent or Express Care visits Copays for these services are still expected, but not required, at the time care is provided. If you are covered by Medicaid or traditional Medicare, this change doesn’t apply to you. What does my health insurance pay? Insurance companies such as Medicare, Medicaid, workers' compensation, commercial health insurance, etc., do not pay charges. Instead, they pay a set price that has been predetermined or negotiated in advance. Every insurance company pays the hospital differently based on their contract. You only pay the out-of-pocket amounts set by your insurance company. While we have provided information on reimbursement amounts for various insurance companies, it is important to note that this is not necessarily the amount you will be required to pay out-of-pocket. What do the following health insurance terms mean? Deductible means the amount you need to pay for health care services before the insurance company begins to pay. The deductible may not apply to all services. Copay means a fixed amount (for example, $20) you will have to pay for a covered health care service. This is paid at the time receive your care, either physician office visit, radiology exam or outpatient or inpatient surgery. Coinsurance means the percentage you pay for a covered health service (for example, 20% of the bill). This is based on the amount your insurance company determines is the allowed amount for the service. You pay coinsurance plus any deductibles and copays you may owe. Your specific health care plan coverage, including the deductible, copay and coinsurance, varies depending on what plan you have selected. Insurance companies also have differing networks of hospitals, physicians and other providers that the plan has contracted with. It is important that you contact your insurance company to discuss this specific information. What is the difference between charges, cost and price? Total Charge is the amount set before any discounts. Hospitals are required by the federal government to utilize uniform charges as the starting point for all bills. This is our chargemaster. The charges are based on what type of care was provided and can differ from patient to patient for similar services, depending on any complications or different treatment provided due to the patient's health. Cost for a hospital is the total expense incurred to provide health care. Hospitals have higher costs to provide care than freestanding or retail providers, even for the same type of service. This is because a hospital is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and needs to have everything necessary to cover any and all emergencies. Total Price is the amount actually paid to a hospital. Hospitals are paid by insurance companies and/or patients, but the total amount paid is significantly less than the total charge. Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance companies pay hospitals according to a set fee schedules or discounts depending on the service provided, much less than the hospital charge. How can I use this hospital charge information for comparing prices? Charge information by itself is not useful in order to determine how much you ultimately may need to pay or to compare the amount you may owe across hospitals. Discounts and fee schedules are used to determine how much private insurance companies pay and may vary from hospital to hospital. These amounts create what is referred to as an allowed amount which is then used by your insurance company to determine how much you may owe. How can I get an estimate for a specific procedure? Cleveland Clinic provides estimates to patients who would like to understand their potential out of pocket expense for upcoming services. Keep in mind that this is only an estimate and the actual out of pocket amount may vary based on when the estimate was run compared with the status of your benefits, the actual service performed, and any complications that may arise. For many services, estimates are provided proactively at the time you schedule your appointment. You also may ask a patient financial advocate for an estimate. Calculate your own estimate Please note: Self-service estimates for Indian River Hospital is under development and will be available soon. What are minimum, maximum, and self-pay amounts? Minimum is the lowest amount paid to the hospital for a given procedure or service during the period surveyed. Maximum is the highest amount paid to the hospital for a given procedure or service during the period surveyed. Self-pay amount is what a patient with no insurance might expect to pay. Uninsured or underinsured patients should consult with our patient financial advocates to determine whether they qualify for discounts. As indicated above, we would suggest taking advantage of our cost estimator for the most accurate information.",

              "content": "Effective on June 3, 2022 At LinkedIn, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies. By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy. What technologies are used? ENTER A SUMMARY Type of technology Description Cookies A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags . We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session). Pixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality. Other similar technologies We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to similar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies. Our cookie tables lists cookies and similar technologies that are used as part of our Services. Please note that the names of cookies and similar technologies may change over time. What are these technologies used for? Below we describe the purposes for which we use these technologies. ENTER SUMMARY Purpose Description Authentication We use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Services. If you’re signed into LinkedIn, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line with your settings. For example, cookies enable LinkedIn to identify you and verify your account. Security We use cookies and similar technologies to make your interactions with our Services faster and more secure. For example, we use cookies to enable and support our security features, keep your account safe and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement. Preferences, features and services We use cookies and similar technologies to enable the functionality of our Services, such as helping you to fill out forms on our Services more easily and providing you with features, insights and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. We also use these technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences. For example, cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. We may also use local storage to speed up site functionality. Customized content We use cookies and similar technologies to customize your experience on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to remember previous searches so that when you return to our services, we can offer additional information that relates to your previous search. Plugins on and off LinkedIn We use cookies and similar technologies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites. For example, our plugins, including the \"Apply with LinkedIn\" button or the \"Share\" button may be found on LinkedIn or third-party sites, such as the sites of our customers and partners. Our plugins use cookies and other technologies to provide analytics and recognize you on LinkedIn and third-party sites. If you interact with a plugin (for instance, by clicking \"Apply\"), the plugin will use cookies to identify you and initiate your request to apply. You can learn more about plugins in our Privacy Policy . Advertising Cookies and similar technologies help us show relevant advertising to you more effectively, both on and off our Services and to measure the performance of such ads. We use these technologies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone who was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another site. Similarly, our partners or service providers may use these technologies to determine whether we've shown an ad or a post and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads. We may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a customer’s or partner’s site or application. These technologies help us provide aggregated information to our customers and partners. For further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see Sections 1.4 and 2.4 of the Privacy Policy . As noted in Section 1.4 of our Privacy Policy, outside Designated Countries , we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. For further information, please see Section 1.4 of the Privacy Policy . Analytics and research Cookies and similar technologies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations. We or our service providers use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including as you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices. We or our service providers, use these technologies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn whether you have interacted with our websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions. We also use these technologies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services. If you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with our Services on that browser until the expiration of the cookie in order to generate usage analytics for our Services. We may share these analytics in aggregate form with our customers. What third parties use these technologies in connection with our Services? Third parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services. For example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for their own marketing purposes. For an illustration, please visit LinkedIn’s Help Center . Third parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services. Third parties may use cookies to help us to provide our Services. We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to analyze and research our Services. Your Choices You have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies and similar technologies. Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to set cookies and similar technologies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information. Opt out of targeted advertising As described in Section 2.4 of the Privacy Policy , you have choices regarding the personalized ads you may see. LinkedIn Members can adjust their settings here .

Table of Contents: Introduction Obligations Rights and Limits Disclaimer and Limit of Liability Termination Governing Law and Dispute Resolution General Terms LinkedIn “Dos and Don’ts” Complaints Regarding Content How To Contact Us Introduction 1.1 Contract When you use our Services you agree to all of these terms. Your use of our Services is also subject to our Cookie Policy and our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information. By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services. As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy , our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in our Privacy Policy , and updates. You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy . Services This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins. LinkedIn and other Key Terms You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as “we” and “us”). Designated Countries . We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland. If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (“LinkedIn Ireland”) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services. If you reside outside of the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn Corp.”) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services. Affiliates . Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (e.g., Github, Inc.). Social Action . Actions that members take on our services such as likes, comments, follows, sharing content. Content . Content includes, for example, feed posts, feedback, comments, profiles, articles (and contributions), group posts, job postings, messages (including InMails), videos, photos, audio, and/or PDFs. 1.2 Members and Visitors This Contract applies to Members and Visitors. When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a “Member”. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a “Visitor.” 1.3 Changes We may make changes to this Contract. We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If we materially change these terms or if we are legally required to provide notice, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. However, we may not always provide prior notice of changes to these terms (1) when those changes are legally required to be implemented with immediate effect, or (2) when those changes relate to a newly launched service or feature. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account . Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the \"Minimum Age\" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use in connection with your work for them (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices and those modified prices will apply prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. If your primary payment method fails, we may automatically charge a secondary payment method, if you have provided one. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit the types of messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 3. Rights and Limits 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it. We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads. As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services. You grant LinkedIn and our Affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways: You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove the content you delete from backup and other systems. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., “Connections only”). For example, if you choose to share your post to \"Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license . You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy. You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings). By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you. You promise to only provide content and other information that you have the right to share and that your LinkedIn profile will be truthful. You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries. 3.2 Service Availability We may change or limit the availability of some features, or end any Service. We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access). We don’t promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you’ve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy. 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps Your use of others’ content and information posted on our Services, is at your own risk. Others may offer their own products and services through our Services, and we aren’t responsible for those third-party activities. Others’ Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature . Others’ Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using Services Marketplace or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products. You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member’s offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products. For Services Marketplace , (a) you must be at least 18 years of age to procure, offer, or perform services, and (b) you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with the relevant industry standards and our Professional Community Policies . Others’ Events: Similarly, LinkedIn may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the conduct of any of the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular event listed on our Services, (3) LinkedIn does not review and/or vet any of these events or speakers, and (4) you will adhere to the terms and conditions that apply to such events. 3.4 Limits We have the right to limit how you connect and interact on our Services. LinkedIn reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. LinkedIn reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you breach this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services (e.g., violating any of the Dos and Don’ts or Professional Community Policies ). We can also remove any content or other information you shared if we believe it violates our Professional Community Policies or Dos and Don’ts or otherwise violates this Contract. Learn more about how we moderate content. 3.5 Intellectual Property Rights We’re providing you notice about our intellectual property rights. LinkedIn reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. Trademarks and logos used in connection with the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners. LinkedIn, and “in” logos and other LinkedIn trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used for our Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of LinkedIn. 3.6 Recommendations and Automated Processing We use data and other information about you to make and order relevant suggestions and to generate content for you and others. Recommendations: We use the data and other information that you provide and that we have about Members and content on the Services to make recommendations for connections, content, ads, and features that may be useful to you. We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. Learn More Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others. Like all content you share on our Services, you are responsible for ensuring it complies with our Professional Community Policies , including not sharing misleading information. The Services may include content automatically generated and shared using tools offered by LinkedIn or others off LinkedIn. Like all content and other information on our Services, regardless of whether it's labeled as created by “AI”, be sure to carefully review before relying on it. 4. Disclaimer and Limit of Liability 4.1 No Warranty This is our disclaimer of legal liability for the quality, safety, or reliability of our Services. LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT, OUTPUT AND INFORMATION) ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. If you plan to use content, output and information for any reason, it is your responsibility to verify its accuracy and fitness for your purposes, because any content, output and information on the service may not reflect accurate, complete, or current information. 4.2 Exclusion of Liability These are the limits of legal liability we may have to you. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS LINKEDIN HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR ANY AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS (A) THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO LINKEDIN FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE TERM OF THIS CONTRACT, IF ANY, OR (B) US $1000. 4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and LinkedIn and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if LinkedIn or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY OR FOR FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR IN CASES OF NEGLIGENCE, WHERE A MATERIAL OBLIGATION HAS BEEN BREACHED. A MATERIAL OBLIGATION BEING AN OBLIGATION WHICH FORMS A PREREQUISITE TO OUR DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND ON WHICH YOU MAY REASONABLY RELY, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DAMAGES WERE DIRECTLY CAUSED BY THE BREACH AND WERE FORESEEABLE UPON CONCLUSION OF THIS CONTRACT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE TYPICAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONTRACT. 5. Termination We can each end this Contract, but some rights and obligations survive. Both you and LinkedIn may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the Services. The following shall survive termination: Our rights to use and disclose your feedback; Section 3 (subject to 3.1.1); Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8.2 of this Contract; and Any amounts owed by either party prior to termination remain owed after termination. You can visit our Help Center to learn about how to close your account 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, depending on where you live, you and LinkedIn agree to resolve it in California courts using California law, Dublin, Ireland courts using Irish law, or as otherwise provided in this section. If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland. If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center . For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts. You may have additional rights of redress and appeal for some decisions made by LinkedIn that impact you. 7. General Terms Here are some important details about the Contract. If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract. This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services. If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract. You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10. 8. LinkedIn “Dos and Don’ts” LinkedIn is a community of professionals.

Your use of our Services is also subject to our Cookie Policy and our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information. By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services. As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy , our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in our Privacy Policy , and updates. You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy . Services This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins. LinkedIn and other Key Terms You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as “we” and “us”). Designated Countries . We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland. If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (“LinkedIn Ireland”) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services. If you reside outside of the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn Corp.”) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services. Affiliates . Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (e.g., Github, Inc.). Social Action . Actions that members take on our services such as likes, comments, follows, sharing content. Content . Content includes, for example, feed posts, feedback, comments, profiles, articles (and contributions), group posts, job postings, messages (including InMails), videos, photos, audio, and/or PDFs. 1.2 Members and Visitors This Contract applies to Members and Visitors. When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a “Member”. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a “Visitor.” 1.3 Changes We may make changes to this Contract. We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If we materially change these terms or if we are legally required to provide notice, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. However, we may not always provide prior notice of changes to these terms (1) when those changes are legally required to be implemented with immediate effect, or (2) when those changes relate to a newly launched service or feature. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account . Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date. 2. Obligations 2.1 Service Eligibility Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract: You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.” The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the \"Minimum Age\" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16. “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More 2.2 Your Account You will keep your password a secret You will not share your account with anyone else and will follow our policies and the law. Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don’ts (below), and our Professional Community Policies . Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use in connection with your work for them (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. 2.3 Payment You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices. Refunds are subject to our policy, and we may modify our prices and those modified prices will apply prospectively. If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates). We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. If your primary payment method fails, we may automatically charge a secondary payment method, if you have provided one. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services. We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law. All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy . We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us. You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “ Purchase History ”. 2.4 Notices and Messages You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices. You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. Please review your settings to control and limit the types of messages you receive from us. 2.5 Sharing When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information. Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice. 3. Rights and Limits 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn You own all of your original content that you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it. We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your content, including how it can be used for ads. As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services. You grant LinkedIn and our Affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways: You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove the content you delete from backup and other systems. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., “Connections only”). For example, if you choose to share your post to \"Anyone on or off LinkedIn” (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license . You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy. You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings). By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you. You promise to only provide content and other information that you have the right to share and that your LinkedIn profile will be truthful. You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries. 3.2 Service Availability We may change or limit the availability of some features, or end any Service. We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access). We don’t promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you’ve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy. 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps Your use of others’ content and information posted on our Services, is at your own risk. Others may offer their own products and services through our Services, and we aren’t responsible for those third-party activities.

You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature . Others’ Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using Services Marketplace or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products. You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member’s offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products. For Services Marketplace , (a) you must be at least 18 years of age to procure, offer, or perform services, and (b) you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with the relevant industry standards and our Professional Community Policies .

Recommendations: We use the data and other information that you provide and that we have about Members and content on the Services to make recommendations for connections, content, ads, and features that may be useful to you. We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. Learn More Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others.

If you plan to use content, output and information for any reason, it is your responsibility to verify its accuracy and fitness for your purposes, because any content, output and information on the service may not reflect accurate, complete, or current information. 4.2 Exclusion of Liability These are the limits of legal liability we may have to you. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS LINKEDIN HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR ANY AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS (A) THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO LINKEDIN FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE TERM OF THIS CONTRACT, IF ANY, OR (B) US $1000. 4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and LinkedIn and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if LinkedIn or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY OR FOR FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR IN CASES OF NEGLIGENCE, WHERE A MATERIAL OBLIGATION HAS BEEN BREACHED.

You can visit our Help Center to learn about how to close your account 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, depending on where you live, you and LinkedIn agree to resolve it in California courts using California law, Dublin, Ireland courts using Irish law, or as otherwise provided in this section. If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland. If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center . For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts. You may have additional rights of redress and appeal for some decisions made by LinkedIn that impact you. 7. General Terms Here are some important details about the Contract. If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract. This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services. If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract. You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10. 8. LinkedIn “Dos and Don’ts” LinkedIn is a community of professionals.

Learn how Cleveland Clinic caregivers pursue the guiding principle of ‘Patients First’ by improving patient care through research. The Future of Healthcare and Research Since 1921 Since its founding in 1921 , research has been an integral part of Cleveland Clinic’s mission. The founders believed it was not only important to treat patients, but also to investigate the causes of disease. A century later, Cleveland Clinic is at the forefront of scientific discovery. Our researchers are leaders in growing fields transforming the way medicine is delivered, including precision medicine, genomics, population health and immuno-oncology. Lab-based and translational researchers work to uncover novel biological pathways that contribute to a host of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, brain and eye diseases, and diseases of the inflammation and immune systems. They work closely with clinical researchers from all areas of Cleveland Clinic to translate basic biological research discoveries into new diagnostic tests and treatments—including medical devices and therapeutics—that will benefit patients worldwide. Pictured: One of the first instances of ground-breaking research at Cleveland Clinic beginning during the 1920's. Otto Glasser, MD, invented a way of accurately measuring the radiation doses being given to patients during what was then called Roentgen ray therapy (radiotherapy for cancer). The groundbreaking device was called a dosimeter. Ohio Invests in Our Future In partnership with the State of Ohio and JobsOhio , Cleveland Clinic has launched the Global Center for Pathogen Research & Human Health to study present and future pandemic threats and to develop novel diagnostic tests, vaccines and treatments. The $500M center ($200M from Ohio, $300M from Cleveland Clinic) will expand upon Cleveland Clinic’s existing programs and expertise in immunological research, with newly recruited world leaders in immunology and pathogen research as well as technology development and education. The center is part of Ohio’s $1B investment in Northeast Ohio to create the Cleveland Innovation District — a biomedical hub that will drive economic growth and lead to improved health for Ohioans and patients around the globe. As part of the Innovation District, Cleveland Clinic will join Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland State University, MetroHealth, and University Hospitals. In addition to a focus on research and development, the center is expected to generate 8,500 jobs in Ohio.

The goal of the HIE’s is to help participating physicians and providers give better, more efficient care to their patients by the sharing of health information across secure systems. This means that wherever a patient goes, the patient’s health information may be available to all doctors who use the HIE’s, which helps to provide safer, more coordinated patient care. Cleveland Clinic currently utilizes Care Everywhere , eHealth Exchange and Clinisync to access and share your health information with other participants of these HIE’s for treatment purposes and for payment of treatment services. These HIE’s allow any health information organization that participates in the HIE’s to have secure electronic access to patients’ records. You may opt out of the health information exchanges by doing one of the following: Click on the link to fill out the form to opt-out: Care Everywhere Opt Out Form OR Mail your written request, signed, and dated to the Cleveland Clinic Office of Corporate Compliance and Business Ethics, 3050 Science Park Drive, AC321, Beachwood, OH 44122 Requesting patients should include all the following information with your written request so we can be sure to identify the correct medical information to opt-out from all the Health Information Exchanges that Cleveland Clinic participates in: First and last name (and middle name, if applicable) Cleveland Clinic medical record number Date of birth Address Phone Number Questions: Contact the Cleveland Clinic Privacy Office at 216.444.1709 (toll-free 800.223.2273, ext. 41709 ) NOTICE: If you send health information to Cleveland Clinic via email, please know that your message may be sent in an unencrypted email.

PreCheck-In What is PreCheck-In? PreCheck-In allows you to complete the pre-appointment process ahead of time, from the comfort of home. You can access PreCheck-In for your upcoming appointment in the MyChart mobile app or website as early as a week prior to your visit. With PreCheck-In, you can: Verify and update demographics such as a home address, email address, and phone numbers. Verify and update medical information such as medications, allergies, and current health issues. Verify and update insurance information and upload your insurance card image. Pay your insurance copay with a credit or debit card. Electronically sign required forms or documents. Complete pre-visit health questionnaires. How long does PreCheck-In take? The number of steps to complete may vary based on the type of appointment and when you were last seen. We recommend completing PreCheck-In at least one day before your visit to make sure you are prepared for your appointment. Do I have to sign-up for MyChart to use PreCheck-In? No. We are now sending PreCheck-In email reminders to all of our established patients with an email address on file. If you do not currently have a MyChart account, you receive a secure link that gives you temporary MyChart access to complete PreCheck-In. For security reasons, when you click the link, you will be asked to confirm your identity by verifying your demographic information. Once you complete PreCheck-In, you will have the option to create a MyChart account for yourself. Is PreCheck-In required to receive care at Cleveland Clinic? PreCheck-In is a required step for scheduled video visits. It is optional for in-person appointments and surgical visits . If you don’t complete PreCheck-In, you will need to check in at a registration desk or kiosk on your day of service. If you’d like to use Mobile Check-In when you arrive for your appointment, you must complete PreCheck-In first. If you skip certain PreCheck-In steps (such as copay payment or document signature), you will be prompted to complete check-in at the front desk. How do I pay my copay? You can choose to pay your copay during PreCheck-In or when you arrive to check-in at your appointment. You can use a credit card saved in your MyChart eWallet or add a new one. We’ll preauthorize the card, but you won’t be charged until your appointment is over. How does document signature work? During PreCheck-In, you will be able to view any forms that you need your signatures, such as our privacy practices or informed consent documents. You can then add an electronic signature to confirm that you have reviewed the information. To electronically sign documents, you will need to complete all required fields, including providing your home and cell phone numbers. If you are using the MyChart mobile app, you may need to swipe to the side to find these fields. Mobile Check-In Can I check in online for my upcoming appointment? We’re now offering the ability to complete the check-in process through both the MyClevelandClinic and MyChart mobile apps.* Mobile Check-In is an optional step that notifies your care team when you arrive for your appointment, allowing you to skip the line at the front desk.

Use a credit card or checking account, and save this information securely for future use. Pay the full account balance at once or a portion. Create or update payment plans with monthly auto-payment. Review all previous payment details. Pay as a guest on the login page if you do not wish to create an account. How do I create or adjust a payment plan? Once your statement is available, you will have the option to create a payment plan from your Account Summary in MyChart. Creating a payment plan means a set amount will be automatically charged to your credit card or deducted from your bank account on the same date each month. You will be able to choose the amount and the date; however, the system will require a minimum payment based on the total amount owed. You may also update an existing payment plan by changing the monthly amount, payment date, and/or payment method. Please note the following: New balance amounts may be automatically added to your payment plan, which will increase the length of time needed to complete it. The monthly amount paid will not change. Large balances that would require an increase in your monthly payment amount are not automatically added to an existing payment plan. All balance amounts that have not been included in a payment plan should be paid by the due date indicated on the statement. If you have any questions regarding your payment plan or billing statement, please contact customer service at 866.621.6385. Paperless Billing Statements What does it mean when you say, “transitioning to paperless statements?” Your billing statements will default to paperless for Cleveland Clinic MyChart users who are responsible for an account(s). We’ll send your statements electronically via MyChart instead of by mail. If you prefer to keep paper statements, you can log in to MyChart and choose to keep getting paper statements.

To opt out and keep getting paper statements, please follow these instructions: Click the Menu button and choose Account Summary . Select the Cancel Paperless Billing link at the bottom of the Billing Summary page. Confirm that you want to cancel paperless billing. What happens if I don’t realize that I have a statement ready for payment in MyChart and I miss the due date? If your payment is 60 days past due, we’ll automatically switch your billing statement back to paper, and you’ll receive a paper copy in the mail. What if I try paperless statements and don’t like it? Can I go back to getting paper statements? Yes, you can opt-out of receiving paperless statements. You can do this in your MyChart mobile app or MyChart website. To opt out and keep getting paper statements, please follow these instructions: Click the Menu button and choose Account Summary . Select the Cancel Paperless Billing link at the bottom of the Billing Summary page. Confirm that you want to cancel paperless billing. I’m still receiving paper billing statements from radiology, anesthesiology and certain laboratory services. I thought all statements would be paperless? Cleveland Clinic contracts with outside healthcare providers for some services. These include — but aren’t limited to — radiology, anesthesiology and certain laboratory services. For these services, you’ll continue to receive paper statements unless you have made prior arrangements with those outside providers. I need help opting out of paperless billing. Is there someone I can call for assistance? Yes, Cleveland Clinic customer service representatives can help you opt out of paperless billing. Call 216.445.6249 or toll-free at 866.621.6385 after Sept. 1, 2022. My children and/or parents have accounts, but I’m responsible for their bills. Will they receive billing statements, or will the statements come to me? If your child is under the age of 18, and you’re responsible for their account, you’ll receive the billing statement. Anyone age 18 and over will be sent their statements directly unless you are the person responsible for the account (guarantor). If the patient is enrolled in MyChart, we’ll automatically transition them to paperless billing on Sept. 1, 2022. What if my email address changes?

You can send a secure message to your established provider regarding a non-urgent medical concern with Message My Doctor’s Office . A member of your healthcare team will respond within three business days. An established provider is a provider that you have seen within the last three years. Message My Doctor’s Office cannot be used to receive a diagnosis. Please schedule an appointment to address a new health issue. Find more tips on using Message My Doctor’s office. If you are experiencing an urgent medical problem, call 911 or your physician's office immediately. Will I get billed for MyChart messages? Starting November 17, 2022, some MyChart messages will now be billed to your insurance. These are messages that take a longer amount of time for your provider to answer. They might also require your provider to dive into your medical history or look into changes to your treatment plan. MyChart questions like scheduling an appointment, getting a prescription refill or checking in after a procedure will continue to be free. Why are some messages billed to insurance? MyChart messaging has become a popular way to seek care at your convenience, saving time spent in the office or connecting through a video visit. The number of messages from patients seeking complex medical advice has increased drastically in recent years, and our providers spend a significant amount of time each day responding to these messages. Insurance companies, Medicaid and Medicare recognize that messaging is another way for patients to receive care. Messages that require more than 5 minutes of your provider’s time and expertise are considered a form of telehealth and will be treated as such. It is important to understand that most messages sent through MyChart are handled quickly and will not be billed to insurance. If your message is billed to your insurance, you may not be charged or may see a low out-of-pocket cost. What types of providers will bill for messages? You will only ever be billed by a provider who is licensed to practice medicine without direction. This means you will not be billed when a clinician such as a registered nurse, social worker, or resident physician replies to your message. The kinds of providers who are currently billing for MyChart messages include: Certified nurse midwives. Licensed clinical psychologists (Ohio only). Nurse practitioners / Clinical nurse specialists. Physician assistants. Physicians. Optometrists. Will I be billed for messages from my care coordinator? No. Messages related to your Chronic Care Management program or other care coordination services will not be billed, as these communications are managed by nurses and social workers. Will I be billed when my provider sends the first message? You will not be billed when your provider initiates a message exchange with you. However, if you reply with a question about a new problem unrelated to the original conversation, the response may be billed if it takes more than five minutes for your provider to answer. Additionally, you will not be billed for submitting requested information such as home monitoring data (for example, blood pressure readings) or for completing questionnaires. What if I have questions about my bill or need financial assistance? Visit our Billing and Finance page for more information and to contact a customer service representative. Will someone answer my MyChart message 24/7? Our providers will do their best to answer your questions quickly. However, there are certain times when you won’t get a response. Our providers won’t respond to messages on nights, weekends or holidays. MyChart messages are not for urgent issues. If you have an emergency, please call 911 or go to your local emergency department. Will my provider contact me through MyChart? Your provider may add a comment within your test results or send a secure message to help you understand what the results mean. They may also recommend that you make a follow-up appointment, provide you with additional instructions, or ask you to call the office to discuss your test results. Your Medical Record My Preventive Care recommendations don't seem right to me, what should I do? Preventive Care procedures are suggested based on your age and gender, and in some cases, your individual health conditions. You are encouraged to discuss this information with your provider during your visit, and they can update any recommendations that may not apply to your specific situation. If you see that you are overdue for a regularly scheduled Preventive Care item, you can request an appointment through the Request An Appointment feature. How do I view clinical notes? Many types of clinical notes are accessible in MyChart. To view them, click on a past visit or hospital stay within Upcoming and Past Appointments in the main menu. On the mobile app, tap the Appointments icon and select a past visit or hospital stay. Notes are written in a way for your doctor and other health professionals on your care team to quickly understand your current health status. For help understanding your notes, review a list of common medical terms and abbreviations . Although patient education is not the purpose of clinical notes, we hope that the release of this information will allow you to become more involved and knowledgeable regarding your healthcare . Learn more about Clinical Notes . How do I view my orders? Click Upcoming Orders in the Appointments Menu. Standing and Future orders will display. Other tests ordered by your physician may appear in your After Visit Summary located in the Past Appointments menu. A Standing Order is a series of two or more of the same test, to be completed at a specified frequency (for example, once a month). A Future Order is a test to be completed within a time frame specified by your provider. If a date displays in the expected date column, your provider would like for you to complete testing on the date indicated or a couple of days after this date. If no date displays in the expected date column and the testing was not completed at the time of your office visit, contact your provider to determine when the testing should be completed. Be sure to follow any instructions your provider gives you regarding your orders. If you have any questions regarding the best date to complete your tests, contact your provider’s office. How do I download or send my Visit Summary? You may download or send your Visit Summary from a past appointment, emergency department visit, or hospital stay. In the Health menu, click My Document Center , and select Visit Records . In this section, you may download one or multiple visit summaries at one time, and you may send these summaries to a provider outside of Cleveland Clinic. How do I get the complete set of my medical records? My Document Center allows you to request the release of up to 50 pages of your medical record to your account. You may obtain your complete medical record by contacting Health Information Management . Although Cleveland Clinic makes every effort to provide your medical records as quickly as possible, the HIPAA Privacy Rule gives Cleveland Clinic up to 30 days to respond to your request for medical records. If we are not able to respond within 30 days of receipt of your request, we will notify you in writing of the delay. Records released to your account will be available for 30 days to download, view, print, or save to another location. At this time, the option to send your child’s medical records to your account is not available. Please contact HIM for these requests at 216.444.5580. Test Results When are my results released? At Cleveland Clinic we consider patients a part of the care team, and timely access to your health information is an important part of the decision-making process. In our commitment to transparency, patients have access to most test results as soon as they are available. Certain types of results, such as biopsies, are released after a short delay. These results and notes could include sensitive information such as a cancer diagnosis or the sex of your baby. You always have the choice to wait to view your information in MyChart until you speak with your provider. Can I see my radiology images? The text portion of your radiology imaging report can be viewed in Test Results . The actual radiology images are not available at this time. Contact the Radiology Department to request copies of your images (for example, X-Rays or CT Scans). Medications Why don't all my medications appear in my list? Your medication list will only show current prescriptions, discontinued medications are not included. Prescriptions from healthcare providers outside of Cleveland Clinic will not appear unless they are documented by your Cleveland Clinic provider. How do I renew prescriptions? You may submit a renewal request when you are out of refills for a medication that has been prescribed by a Cleveland Clinic provider. You should provide the following information for a prescription renewal: Your preferred pharmacy. The number of pills (30 or 90 day supply). The number of refills for the prescription. The method by which the renewal should be processed (i.e., should it be sent to the pharmacy or mailed to your home). Any new allergies that you have experienced. Every attempt is made to process prescription renewals within 48 hours during normal business hours. If you submit your request on a weekend or holiday, it will be received the next business day. How do I refill prescriptions? If your prescription is on file at a Cleveland Clinic outpatient pharmacy , you can request refills through MyChart, using the same process to request a renewal. This will send the request directly to the pharmacy, and you will be contacted by phone or text message when your medication is ready for pick-up. If you are out of refills for your medication, your request will be sent to your provider for a renewal. Please note: Refills for Cleveland Clinic mail-order pharmacies cannot be requested in MyChart. Information From Other Organizations What types of information can I see from organizations outside of Cleveland Clinic? Many healthcare organizations participate in an information-sharing initiative that will allow you to view your information from other healthcare providers within your Cleveland Clinic MyChart account. You will be able to view your medications, allergies, and health issues from other participating organizations. You will also be able to see a list of your current physicians and providers in your Care Team. If you have signed up for MyChart at other participating organizations, you will be able to see test results, view and send messages, and view appointments. Why don’t I see information from all of my healthcare organizations? There are a few reasons why you may not see health information you expected to appear: Not all healthcare organizations are currently participating in this information-sharing initiative. You are not signed up for MyChart at another organization. Having an active MyChart account with a participating organization will enable you to view additional types of information in your Cleveland Clinic MyChart account. You did not give consent to link your accounts when prompted. Access the Manage My Accounts section in the Profile menu, and a list of available organizations for which you have health information will display. Click “ Link ” to add the organization to your Cleveland Clinic MyChart account. Can I unlink my MyChart accounts? Yes. The Manage My Accounts section in the Profile menu allows you to link and unlink your MyChart accounts from other organizations. Updating Your Health Information How do I submit updates to my health information? To submit a request to add a new item: Click the while in the Current Health Issues, Allergies, or Medications section. In the search box, type in the first few words of your health issue, allergy, or medication, and click search. Select the option from the search results that is the best fit for your individual situation. For allergies, select all reactions that occur when you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to. In the comment section, add details that will help your provider understand your request. For example, to add lower back pain as a problem: “It started in 2012 after injury, tried physical therapy without success. Surgery on lower back in 2017 did not completely resolve the pain, currently treating with Tylenol which only moderately helps to decrease the pain.” Click Accept . To request to delete an item: Click the minus icon next to the item you would like your provider to remove. In the text box, please enter additional information for your provider to better understand why this health issue should be removed from your list. For example, to remove Plantar Fasciitis from your problem list: “I was treated in 2015 with physical therapy and shoe inserts. I no longer have pain or inflammation upon walking or exercising.” If you feel that information in your record is incorrect or added in error, please submit a “Request for Amendment of Protected Health Information” in MyChart. What types of health issues should be included on my list? The Current Health Issues section displays what is called the “Problem List” in your Cleveland Clinic electronic medical record. Your Problem List contains the ongoing health issues that currently affect your well-being, and does not include temporary health concerns such as a urinary tract infection or the flu. Find for more information on the Problem List and how your providers use this information to manage your care . How is an allergy defined for addition to my list? Allergies are your body's reaction to a substance it views as a harmful “invader.” For example, coming into contact with what is normally a harmless substance, such as pollen, might cause the immune system (the body's defense system) to react. Substances that cause these reactions are called allergens. For more information: What is a drug allergy? What is a food allergy? Managing Appointments Why are only a limited number of providers available when I use the Schedule My Appointment or Request an Appointment features? Schedule My Appointment enables you to view your established provider’s open schedule and instantly book an appointment online. This feature is available for select specialty departments, and internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics. Request an Appointment is available for all departments with your established providers, and enables you to select your preferred dates and times, or request the first available appointment. An appointment scheduler will book the appointment for you and send a secure message with the appointment details. An established provider is a provider you have seen in the last three years. Adding Your Loved Ones How may I view a family member or loved one’s information? MyChart users can add their loved ones to their personal MyChart account, which allows: Parents or court-appointed guardians of minor children (age 17 years and younger) to manage their healthcare online. Court-appointed guardians of dependent adults to manage their healthcare online. Family members or caregivers of adults who provide legal authorization to manage their healthcare online. You do not have to be a current Cleveland Clinic patient in order to access your loved ones' information. When pediatric patients turn 18 years old, MyChart access is automatically removed from the parent's account. Access Your Child’s MyChart Option 1: To request access online, log in to your account and select Request Family Access in the Messaging menu. Option 2: Ask for access to your child’s account when scheduling your next appointment or ask for assistance at your pediatrician’s office. Option 3: Complete and submit these forms and the appropriate documentation (submission instructions are included): Parent or court-appointed guardian of a minor patient .

Court-appointed guardian of an adult patient . Can I give a family member or loved one access to my information? If you’d like, you may authorize a loved one to access your MyChart account. Visit the Share My Record page from the Health menu to grant access and send an invitation. My Personal Information How do I find my medical record number (MRN)?

The curriculum centers on problem-based learning, with no formal lectures or class rankings. Students aren’t given grades but, rather, are assessed, and self-assess, using a portfolio-based system. Graduate Medical Education One of the largest training programs in the country, Cleveland Clinic’s Graduate Medical Education program offers residents and fellows the chance to see rare and complex cases in addition to routine medical problems. Our trainees engage in leading-edge research in basic sciences, clinical medicine and biomedical engineering alongside our scientists and clinical faculty. Health Professions Education Caregivers within the health professions comprise a large part of Cleveland Clinic’s workforce, having skills that are essential to patient care. Health professions jobs range from physician assistant and physical therapist to medical laboratory technician and histotechnologist. We sponsor internal training programs and offer clinical rotations for health professions students enrolled in training programs outside of Cleveland Clinic. Learn more about Cleveland Clinic's Center for Health Professions Education . Center for Educational Resources Faculty in this center support and train internal colleagues who have a teaching role at Cleveland Clinic, including those involved in teaching within our Lerner College of Medicine and residency and fellowship programs. They ensure that our educators know how to develop a curriculum, how to assess learners and how to evaluate educational programs. The center also offers a medical education fellowship opportunity to advance the skills of our educators. Youth and College Education The Center for Youth and College Education (CYCE) provides educational experiences and career exploration opportunities to K-12 youth and college students. By offering meaningful real-world experiences to learners, we hope to prepare the next generation of caregivers to join the healthcare workforce.

We treat the individual as well as the disease. For example, our emergency, critical care and hospital medicine teams work closely to ensure patients experience seamless, coordinated care throughout their inpatient journey. Our Departments Emergency Medicine We deliver expert care across 29 emergency departments — including one Level I and two Level II trauma centers — most of which are Geriatric Emergency Department-accredited. Our teams manage high-acuity patients, with many arriving via EMS, and support nearly two-thirds of all system admissions. Cleveland Clinic Immediate Care extends access through our Urgent Cares, Express Cares and Express Care Online platform. Hospital Medicine Our 24/7 hospitalist program spans seven hospitals and manages some of the highest-acuity patients in the country.

Our team leads one of the nation’s largest critical care programs, with nationally recognized programs in ECMO, liver ICU care and post-ICU recovery. We also innovate across care delivery, including virtual ICU rounds, tele-critical care and rapid sepsis response. Infectious Disease We provide comprehensive care across general and subspecialty infectious disease, with programs spanning HIV, transplant ID, endocarditis, nontuberculosis mycobacteria/granuloma and neurologic infections. Our team leads efforts in antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention and outpatient IV antibiotic management. Innovations in care delivery include virtual consultations, a pharmacy-led travel clinic and specialized post-COVID care.

Industry Relationships Cleveland Clinic physicians and scientists collaborate with industry to advance medical breakthroughs. These partnerships help commercialize discoveries for public benefit while maintaining scientific integrity. To ensure transparency and minimize potential bias, Cleveland Clinic reviews these relationships and publicly discloses when physicians/scientists receive significant compensation for consulting, serve in fiduciary roles, receive royalties, or hold equity interests related to their work. We manage potential conflicts through approval processes, annual reporting, and targeted management plans. As of 2025-06-24, Dr. Gordon has reported no financial relationship with industry that is applicable to this listing. In general, patients should feel free to contact their doctor about any of the relationships and how the relationships are overseen by Cleveland Clinic.

Public Health Service-Reportable Financial Conflicts of Interest. Cleveland Clinic scientists and physicians engage in basic, translational and clinical research activities, working to solve health problems, enhance patient care and improve quality of life for patients. Interactions with industry are essential to bringing the researchers' discoveries to the public, but can present the potential for conflicts of interest related to their research activities. Click here to view a listing of instances where Cleveland Clinic has identified a Public Health Service (PHS)-Reportable Financial Conflict of Interest and has put measures in place to ensure that, to the extent possible, the design, conduct and reporting of the research is free from bias. * Cleveland Clinic physicians and scientists subscribe to the guidance presented in the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals and the AdvaMed Code of Ethics on Interactions with Health Care Professionals.

              "content": "People have a variety of reasons for wanting to donate their body to medical science. Many people do so because they value education. Often they are educators themselves. They appreciate the education they received when they were younger, and their commitment to “paying it forward” becomes their legacy. Others donate their bodies to medicine because they value medical care they personally received. For many, it was a treatment that worked, confirmation that medicine is evolving and that we’re helping more people now than ever before. For others, it was a treatment that failed, a signal that we need to learn more, work harder. In either case, the value is in the medical breakthroughs that result when education, research and innovative thinking converge. Some are repaying a gift they received years before, having learned their way around the human body through the generosity of another. The human body is marvelous and, yes, mysterious. We may never learn everything there is to know about our bodies or how to treat every ailment that plagues us, but by advancing medical science and through the selfless generosity of donors, knowledge grows.

During the event, we celebrate those who lived their lives with a spirit of generosity and service to others. The attendees hear from Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University medical students — the main beneficiaries of the body donation program — and clinical educators to help families better understand the importance of this priceless gift. Throughout the event, attendees enjoy classical musical and vocal performances. As a way to give thanks and cement the legacy of donors, each donor’s name is read aloud, and attendees are invited to light a candle in their memory. For family members and friends, attending the event gives them a sense of closure and the knowledge that their loved one’s gift will help advance the future of medicine. For us, the event offers a chance to honor our donors and express our gratitude for their priceless generosity. View the recording of the 2025 Celebration of Life & Learning .

              "content": "Overview Institute Summary In 2023, the Respiratory Institute (RI) included the departments of Pulmonary Medicine, Critical Care Medicine, Infectious Disease, and Allergy/Immunology. In addition to providing general pulmonary, critical care, infectious disease, and allergy services, the RI provided advanced subspecialty services that attract patients from around the United States and the world. Almost 20% of patients came from outside northeast Ohio and all patients benefit from the expertise of more than 200 staff physicians, 45 fellows, and 137 advance practice providers. The educational activities of the RI included 6 fellowship programs, active participation in student and resident education, and several CME offerings. The RI conducted research activities across the spectrum of basic, translational, and clinical research supported by federal grants, industry-sponsored trials, foundation awards, and philanthropy. The RI’s presence in all Cleveland Clinic northeast Ohio hospitals and our integrated institute model allowed us to respond to the continued lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic with a system-wide approach. Information, education, and best practices were shared by the RI and providers and resources were mobilized across the entire system and beyond. Specialized units were established by the RI that allowed innovation and evaluation of new management approaches, leading to great outcomes for our patients. View our statistics below.

As one of the world’s top hospitals, Cleveland Clinic wants to empower you with the trustworthy information you need to understand your body and make decisions about your health. Simply curious? Panic Googling at 2 a.m.? We’re here for you when you need us. That’s why we’ve curated collections of information to best meet your needs: Health Library — Deep dives into diseases, conditions, treatments and body systems. Health Essentials — Health and wellness articles that explain hot trends or how to live healthier every day. Our voice Four doctors started Cleveland Clinic in 1921. We’re a nonprofit, physician-led organization. We have more than 23,000 on our team, including physicians, surgeons, nurses and more. We’re surrounded by experts. They’re what sets us apart. They’re our fellow caregivers and friends. That’s why, when you read our content, it’s like you’re calling up your best friend — who happens to be a doctor. They explain things in a way you can understand. We try to predict and answer all your questions. We’re conversational and talk directly to you. That means, yes, you’ll find a lot of contractions. “Isn’t” and “you’ll” is how we speak, after all. We also say kids, pee, poop, snot and a lot of other words you might not expect because that’s how friends talk. You may not find some of what we say in the AP Stylebook, as we have our own in-house style guide, too. It helps us prioritize things that are important to us. We hope the fact that we care about you and your family rings through. Our commitment to our readers At Cleveland Clinic, we feel that healthcare communication should do no harm. We recognize that words influence how you experience healthcare — and the actions you take. Language can also motivate or stigmatize already marginalized groups. And we don’t make assumptions about people. That’s why we use person-centered, empathetic language. We want to welcome you as you are. Not your health condition. Not your disability. Not your gender or race. We’ll typically use person-first language, but we also realize that some groups embrace and prefer identity-first language. This means we try our best to honor what our readers want. Yet, since we can’t personally ask you about your preference, we kindly ask you to read our content assuming positive intent. We also recognize that language constantly evolves. So, our work in this space is never finished. We review our editorial policies every year to double-check that we’re up-to-date. Our editorial process A team of professional writers (journalists and academics) crafts every article on our site. They thoroughly research their topics and are passionate about explaining your health in a way that keeps you reading. As an academic medical center, we believe in evidence-based medicine. This means we’ll link to our research so you can see our sources. But that also means we debunk popular myths you hear on the internet. Our writers interview and quote our healthcare providers. Or we research and write articles in an area of focus. Either way, a Cleveland Clinic medical expert reviews each and every article for medical accuracy. Then, our proofreading team ensures our articles are clear and error-free. You’ll find dates on our articles. That’s because while much of healthcare doesn’t change, sometimes things do. We’re always reviewing our content to make sure it’s the most recent and accurate information possible. Think you’ve found an error? (We are still human.) Please reach out at editorial@ccf.org .",

              "content": "Key facts Tobacco kills up to half of its users who don’t quit (1–3) . Tobacco kills more than 7 million people each year, including an estimated 1.6 million non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke (4) . Around 80% of the world's 1.3 billion tobacco users live in low- and middle-income countries. To address the tobacco epidemic, WHO Member States adopted the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2003. Currently 183 countries are Parties to this treaty. The WHO MPOWER measures are in line with the WHO FCTC and have been shown to save lives and reduce costs from averted healthcare expenditure. Overview The tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced, responsible for over 7 million deaths annually as well as disability and long-term suffering from tobacco-related diseases (4) . All forms of tobacco use are harmful, and there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco. Cigarette smoking is the most common form of tobacco use worldwide. Other tobacco products include waterpipe tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, heated tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, pipe tobacco, bidis and kreteks, and smokeless tobacco products. Around 80% of the 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide live in low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest. Tobacco use contributes to poverty by diverting household spending from basic needs such as food and shelter to tobacco. This spending behaviour is difficult to curb because tobacco is so addictive. The economic costs of tobacco use are substantial and include significant health care costs for treating the diseases caused by tobacco use as well as the lost human capital that results from tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality. Key measures to reduce the demand for tobacco Surveillance is key Good monitoring tracks the extent and character of the tobacco epidemic and indicates how best to tailor policies. Almost half of the world's population are regularly asked about their tobacco use in nationally representative surveys among adults and adolescents. More on monitoring tobacco use Second-hand smoke kills Second-hand smoke is the smoke that fills restaurants, offices, homes, or other enclosed spaces when people smoke tobacco products. There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. Second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer, and kills around 1.6 million people prematurely every year. Over third of the world's population living in 79 countries are protected by comprehensive national smoke-free laws. More on second-hand smoke Tobacco users need help to quit Among smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco, most want to quit. Counselling and medication can more than double a tobacco user’s chance of successful quitting. National comprehensive cessation services with full or partial cost-coverage are available to assist tobacco users to quit in only 31 countries, representing a third of the world's population. More on quitting tobacco Pictorial health warnings work Hard-hitting anti-tobacco mass media campaigns and pictorial health warnings prevent children and other vulnerable groups from taking up tobacco use, and increase the number of tobacco users who quit. Today 62% of the world’s population live in the 110 countries that meet best practice for graphic health warnings, which includes among other criteria, large (50% or more of the main areas of the package) pictorial health warnings displayed in the national language and rotating regularly. 2.9 billion people live in the 36 countries that have aired at least one strong anti-tobacco mass media campaign within the last 2 years. More on tobacco health warnings Bans on tobacco advertising lower consumption Tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship (TAPS) increases and sustains tobacco use by effectively recruiting new tobacco users and discouraging tobacco users from quitting. More than one third of countries (68), representing over a quarter of the world’s population, have completely banned all forms of TAPS. More on tobacco advertising bans Taxes are effective in reducing tobacco use Tobacco taxes are the most cost-effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among youth and low-income groups. A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10% decreases tobacco consumption by about 4% in high-income countries and about 5% in low- and middle-income countries. Even so, high tobacco taxes are rarely implemented. Only 41 countries, with 12% of the world's population, have introduced taxes on tobacco products so that at least 75% of the retail price is tax. More on tobacco taxes Illicit trade of tobacco products must be stopped The illicit trade in tobacco products poses major health, economic and security concerns around the world. It is estimated that 1 in every 10 cigarettes and tobacco products consumed globally is illicit. Experience from many countries demonstrates that illicit trade can be successfully addressed even when tobacco taxes and prices are raised, resulting in increased tax revenues and reduced tobacco use. The WHO FCTC Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade of Tobacco Products (ITP) is the key supply side policy to reduce tobacco use and its health and economic consequences. More on eliminating the illicit trade of tobacco products Newer nicotine and tobacco products Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are tobacco products that produce aerosols containing nicotine and toxic chemicals upon heating of the tobacco, or activation of a device containing the tobacco. They contain the highly addictive substance nicotine, non-tobacco additives and are often flavoured. Despite claims of “risk reduction”, there is no evidence to demonstrate that HTPs are less harmful than conventional tobacco products. Many toxicants found in tobacco smoke are at significantly lower levels in HTP aerosol but HTP aerosol contains other toxicants found sometimes at higher levels than in tobacco smoke, such as glycidol, pyridine, dimethyl trisulfide, acetoin and methylglyoxal. Further, some toxicants found in HTP aerosols are not found in conventional cigarette smoke and may have associated health effects. Additionally, these products are highly variable and some of the toxicants found in the emissions of these products are carcinogens. More on heated tobacco products Electronic cigarettes (or e-cigarettes) are the most common form of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS) but there are others, such as e-cigars and e-pipes. ENDS contain varying amounts of nicotine and harmful emissions. Use of ENDS/ENNDS products is colloquially referred to as ‘vaping’. However this does not mean that they are harmless or emit water vapour. E-cigarette emissions typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful to users and non-users who are exposed to the aerosols second-hand. Some products claiming to be nicotine-free have been found to contain nicotine. Evidence reveals that these products are harmful to health and are not safe. However, it is too early to provide a clear answer on the long-term impacts of using them or being exposed to them. Some recent studies suggest that ENDS use can increase the risk of heart disease and lung disorders. Nicotine exposure in pregnant women can have negative health consequences on the fetus, and nicotine, which is a highly addictive substance is damaging for brain development. More on e-cigarettes Nicotine pouches are pre-portioned pouches that contain nicotine and are similar to traditional smokeless tobacco products such as snus in some respects including appearance, inclusion of nicotine and manner of use (placing them between the gum and lip). They are often promoted, as “tobacco-free”, which can be used anywhere and in some jurisdictions, such as the USA, they are referred to as “white pouches”. WHO response There is a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between the tobacco industry’s interests and public health policy interests. The tobacco industry produces and promotes a product that has been proven scientifically to be addictive, to cause disease and death and to give rise to a variety of social ills, including increased poverty. The scale of the human and economic tragedy that tobacco imposes is shocking, and also preventable. The tobacco industry is fighting to ensure the dangers of their products are concealed, but we are fighting back. The WHO FCTC is a milestone in the promotion of public health. It is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of people to the highest standard of health, provides legal dimensions for international health cooperation and sets high standards for compliance. Since its entry into force in 2005, the WHO FCTC has 182 Parties covering more than 90% of the world’s population. In 2007, WHO introduced a practical, cost-effective initiative to scale up implementation of the demand reduction provisions of the WHO FCTC, called MPOWER. The 6 MPOWER measures are: Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies. Protect people from tobacco use. Offer help to quit tobacco use. Warn about the dangers of tobacco. Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Raise taxes on tobacco. WHO has been monitoring MPOWER measures since 2007. For more details on progress made for tobacco control at global, regional and country level, please refer to the series of WHO reports on the global tobacco epidemic.

A C-section can be planned ahead of time or performed in an emergency. It carries more risk than a vaginal delivery, with a slightly longer recovery period.

Policy Contents Arrow Down Overview Treatment Details Risks / Benefits Recovery and Outlook When To Call the Doctor Additional Details Overview What is a C-section? A C-section, also called a cesarean section or cesarean delivery, is a surgical procedure in which your baby is delivered through incisions in your abdomen and uterus. They’re performed when a vaginal delivery isn’t possible or safe, or when the health of you or your baby is at risk. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy When would I need a C-section? You may need a C-section if you have certain medical conditions or if complications occur during labor in a vaginal delivery. A planned C-section happens when any of the following conditions exist: Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) : CPD is a term that means that your baby’s head or body is too large to pass safely through your pelvis, or your pelvis is too small to deliver an average-sized baby. Previous C-section : Although it’s possible to have a vaginal birth after a previous C-section, it’s not an option for everyone. Factors that can affect this include the type of uterine incision used in the previous C-section and the risk of uterine rupture. Expecting multiples : Although twins can often be delivered vaginally, two or more babies might require a C-section. Placenta previa : In this condition, the placenta is attached too low in your uterus and blocks your baby’s exit through your cervix. Transverse lie : Your baby is in a horizontal, or sideways, position in your uterus. Breech presentation : In a breech presentation , your baby is feet- or bottom-first in your uterus. Some providers may attempt to turn your baby, but a C-section will be necessary if that’s unsuccessful. Health conditions : Conditions like heart disease could worsen with labor during a vaginal birth. A C-section is necessary if you have genital herpes at the time of delivery. Obstruction : A large uterine fibroid, a pelvic fracture or you’re expecting a baby with certain congenital anomalies may also be reasons for a C-section. Advertisement An unplanned C-section delivery might be necessary if any of the following conditions arise during your labor: Labor isn ’ t progressing : Also called prolonged labor, this means your cervix dilates and stops, doesn’t efface (or thin) or your baby stops moving down the birth canal. Umbilical cord compression : The umbilical cord is looped around your baby’s neck or body or caught between your baby’s head and your pelvis. Umbilical cord prolapse : The umbilical cord comes out of your cervix before your baby does. Placental abruption : The placenta separates from the wall of your uterus before your baby is born. Fetal distress : Your baby might develop problems that cause an irregular heart rate during labor. Your obstetrician might decide that the baby can no longer tolerate labor and that a C-section is necessary. How common are C-sections? According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), C-sections account for about 30% of all deliveries in the United States. Treatment Details What can I expect before a C-section? If you have a planned C-section, the following procedures will take place: You'll sign consent forms for the procedure. The anesthesiologist will discuss options for anesthesia . Most often, it's an epidural (or spinal block) that numbs you from your breasts down to your feet. The hair in the area around the incision will be clipped or shaved. A catheter will be inserted to keep your bladder empty. You will have heart and blood pressure monitors applied. You'll get an IV in your hand or arm to give you medicine and fluid. You'll discuss the procedure and what to expect with your obstetrician (if you haven't already). If you need an emergency C-section, your obstetrician delivers your baby quickly because either the health of you or your baby is at risk. However, there's typically not much time to prepare, and you may need general anesthesia because it works faster. What actually happens during a C-section? The first step in a C-section procedure is preparing you for anesthesia. Most planned C-sections use an epidural , so you are awake for the delivery. However, in some cases, you're asleep under general anesthesia. Your abdomen will be cleaned with an antiseptic, and you might have an oxygen mask placed over your mouth and nose to increase oxygen to your baby. Next, your provider places a sterile drape around the incision site and over your legs and chest. Finally, your providers raise a sterile curtain or drape between your head and your lower body. The obstetrician will then make an incision through your skin and into the wall of your abdomen. They might use either a vertical or transverse incision. A horizontal incision is also called a bikini incision. Next, your provider cuts a 3- to 4-inch incision into the wall of your uterus. This incision can also be transverse or vertical. Finally, the obstetrician removes your baby through the incisions. The umbilical cord is cut, the placenta is removed and the incisions are closed with stitches and staples. Advertisement Emergency C-sections follow the same steps; however, the speed at which your baby is removed is different. During a planned C-section, the delivery takes about 10 to 15 minutes. Your provider removes your baby in only a few minutes in an emergency C-section. If you're awake for your C-section surgery, you will be able to see and hold your baby shortly after it's born. What does a C-section feel like? You'll be under anesthesia, which should prevent you from feeling any pain. Most people report feeling a tug or pull when their baby is removed from their abdomen. Are C-sections safe? Vaginal births are usually preferred, but in some cases, a C-section is the only safe option. For example, a C-section is the safer option when your baby is breech or you have placenta previa (placenta covers part of the cervix). A C-section carries risks and benefits, which should be discussed with your pregnancy care provider. How long does a C-section surgery take? The typical C-section takes about 45 minutes from start to finish. After your provider delivers your baby, they'll stitch your uterus and close the incision in your abdomen. Different types of emergencies can arise during a delivery. In some cases, the delivery will happen very quickly, with your baby being delivered in as little as 15 minutes. This is an emergency C-section. Advertisement What happens after a C-section? Like vaginal births, your obstetrician will deliver the placenta after your baby is born. Next, your provider will stitch your uterus and stitch or staple your abdominal muscles. Stitches should dissolve, but staples are removed at the hospital about one week later. Your abdomen will be sore for several days or weeks. In some cases, your provider may prescribe stronger pain medication. You can expect to limit your activities, take it easy and rely on family and friends once you go home. A typical C-section surgery requires at least two to three days in the hospital. Risks / Benefits What are the benefits of a C-section? The advantages of a C-section depend on your pregnancy. In most cases, the biggest benefit of a C-section is that it's safer for both you and your baby. When a vaginal birth is risky or could hurt your baby, most providers will turn to a C-section to minimize risks. Sometimes C-sections are unplanned. For example, if your baby's heart rate drops to an unsafe level, an emergency C-section is safer than letting your baby's heart rate decline further. What are the risks involved in a C-section? Like any surgery, a C-section involves some risks. The risks of complications are slightly higher with C-sections than with vaginal delivery. These might include: Infection. Loss of blood ( hemorrhage ). A blood clot that may break off and enter your bloodstream (embolism). Injury to the bowel or bladder. A cut that might weaken the uterine wall. Abnormalities of the placenta in future pregnancies. Risks from general anesthesia. Fetal injury. Advertisement Other disadvantages of having a C-section are: Recovering from a C-section may be more difficult than a vaginal delivery. C-sections are more likely to cause chronic pelvic pain. You're more likely to have a C-section in future pregnancies. Your baby may have trouble breastfeeding . Your baby may be at greater risk for breathing problems. Recovery and Outlook How long does a C-section recovery take? Once the anesthesia wears off, you’ll begin to feel the pain from the incisions. You might also experience gas pains and have trouble taking deep breaths. Make sure an adult is there to help you get up from bed the first several days following C-section surgery. Most people stay in the hospital between two and three days. A full recovery can take between four and six weeks. Ask your healthcare provider what you can expect during recovery. Most providers recommend avoiding steps, lifting, exercise and other strenuous activities for several weeks. Ask your friends or partner for help with errands, cooking and cleaning so you can rest and recover. Your provider may put restrictions on driving until you're able to turn your body and apply pressure to the pedals with ease. You can expect cramping and bleeding for up to six weeks, as well as some discomfort around the incision. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain may help. Avoid sex for at least six weeks or until your healthcare provider gives you the OK. You will also have a vaginal discharge after the surgery due to the shedding of your uterine lining. The discharge, called lochia , will be red at first and then gradually change to yellow. Be sure to call your healthcare provider if you experience heavy bleeding or a foul odor from the vaginal discharge. Use sanitary pads, not tampons, until you're completely done bleeding. Can I have a baby vaginally after a C-section? The majority of people who had a C-section can consider a vaginal delivery in future pregnancies. If you meet the following criteria, your chances of vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) are significantly increased: Your provider used a low transverse incision. Your pelvis is not too small to accommodate an average-sized baby. You're not expecting multiples. Your first C-section was only performed because your baby was breech. When To Call the Doctor When should I see my healthcare provider? If you have an infection at your C-section incision, contact your healthcare provider. Watch for signs of infection such as: Red or swollen incision. Pus or leaking discharge from the incision. Fever or worsening pain. Other signs of a problem include heavy bleeding or severe pelvic pain and cramping. Additional Details What is more painful: a C-section or natural birth? The level of pain you experience during childbirth is unique. For example, if you opt for an unmedicated vaginal birth, you can expect more pain than someone who had an epidural before a vaginal birth. During a C-section delivery, you won't feel much pain. However, recovering from a C-section may be more painful and take longer than recovering from a natural birth. There isn't a right or wrong answer as to what is more painful because every birth is different. How many C-sections can you have? The number of C-sections you can have is unique to your medical history and pregnancy. An exact number hasn't been agreed on. The surgery may be slightly more complicated each time due to prior incisions or scarring. A note from Cleveland Clinic C-sections are often necessary for the health of you and your baby. If you know you're having a C-section, your obstetrician can walk you through the procedure and discuss the recovery process with you in advance. In the cases where a C-section is unexpected, you may end up feeling upset that your birth plan didn't go as expected. Just know that most providers prefer a vaginal delivery and that the decision to proceed with a C-section was made for you or your baby's wellbeing. The best thing you can do after a C-section delivery is rest and allow others to help you recover. Medically Reviewed Last reviewed on 08/14/2022.
