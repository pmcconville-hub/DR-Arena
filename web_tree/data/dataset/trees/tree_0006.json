Learn how Cleveland Clinic caregivers pursue the guiding principle of ‘Patients First’ by improving patient care through research. The Future of Healthcare and Research Since 1921 Since its founding in 1921 , research has been an integral part of Cleveland Clinic’s mission. The founders believed it was not only important to treat patients, but also to investigate the causes of disease. A century later, Cleveland Clinic is at the forefront of scientific discovery. Our researchers are leaders in growing fields transforming the way medicine is delivered, including precision medicine, genomics, population health and immuno-oncology. Lab-based and translational researchers work to uncover novel biological pathways that contribute to a host of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, brain and eye diseases, and diseases of the inflammation and immune systems. They work closely with clinical researchers from all areas of Cleveland Clinic to translate basic biological research discoveries into new diagnostic tests and treatments—including medical devices and therapeutics—that will benefit patients worldwide. Pictured: One of the first instances of ground-breaking research at Cleveland Clinic beginning during the 1920's. Otto Glasser, MD, invented a way of accurately measuring the radiation doses being given to patients during what was then called Roentgen ray therapy (radiotherapy for cancer). The groundbreaking device was called a dosimeter. Ohio Invests in Our Future In partnership with the State of Ohio and JobsOhio , Cleveland Clinic has launched the Global Center for Pathogen Research & Human Health to study present and future pandemic threats and to develop novel diagnostic tests, vaccines and treatments. The $500M center ($200M from Ohio, $300M from Cleveland Clinic) will expand upon Cleveland Clinic’s existing programs and expertise in immunological research, with newly recruited world leaders in immunology and pathogen research as well as technology development and education. The center is part of Ohio’s $1B investment in Northeast Ohio to create the Cleveland Innovation District — a biomedical hub that will drive economic growth and lead to improved health for Ohioans and patients around the globe. As part of the Innovation District, Cleveland Clinic will join Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland State University, MetroHealth, and University Hospitals. In addition to a focus on research and development, the center is expected to generate 8,500 jobs in Ohio.

As one of the world’s top hospitals, Cleveland Clinic wants to empower you with the trustworthy information you need to understand your body and make decisions about your health. Simply curious? Panic Googling at 2 a.m.? We’re here for you when you need us. That’s why we’ve curated collections of information to best meet your needs: Health Library — Deep dives into diseases, conditions, treatments and body systems. Health Essentials — Health and wellness articles that explain hot trends or how to live healthier every day. Our voice Four doctors started Cleveland Clinic in 1921. We’re a nonprofit, physician-led organization. We have more than 23,000 on our team, including physicians, surgeons, nurses and more. We’re surrounded by experts. They’re what sets us apart. They’re our fellow caregivers and friends. That’s why, when you read our content, it’s like you’re calling up your best friend — who happens to be a doctor. They explain things in a way you can understand. We try to predict and answer all your questions. We’re conversational and talk directly to you. That means, yes, you’ll find a lot of contractions. “Isn’t” and “you’ll” is how we speak, after all. We also say kids, pee, poop, snot and a lot of other words you might not expect because that’s how friends talk. You may not find some of what we say in the AP Stylebook, as we have our own in-house style guide, too. It helps us prioritize things that are important to us. We hope the fact that we care about you and your family rings through. Our commitment to our readers At Cleveland Clinic, we feel that healthcare communication should do no harm. We recognize that words influence how you experience healthcare — and the actions you take. Language can also motivate or stigmatize already marginalized groups. And we don’t make assumptions about people. That’s why we use person-centered, empathetic language. We want to welcome you as you are. Not your health condition. Not your disability. Not your gender or race. We’ll typically use person-first language, but we also realize that some groups embrace and prefer identity-first language. This means we try our best to honor what our readers want. Yet, since we can’t personally ask you about your preference, we kindly ask you to read our content assuming positive intent. We also recognize that language constantly evolves. So, our work in this space is never finished. We review our editorial policies every year to double-check that we’re up-to-date. Our editorial process A team of professional writers (journalists and academics) crafts every article on our site. They thoroughly research their topics and are passionate about explaining your health in a way that keeps you reading. As an academic medical center, we believe in evidence-based medicine. This means we’ll link to our research so you can see our sources. But that also means we debunk popular myths you hear on the internet. Our writers interview and quote our healthcare providers. Or we research and write articles in an area of focus. Either way, a Cleveland Clinic medical expert reviews each and every article for medical accuracy. Then, our proofreading team ensures our articles are clear and error-free. You’ll find dates on our articles. That’s because while much of healthcare doesn’t change, sometimes things do. We’re always reviewing our content to make sure it’s the most recent and accurate information possible. Think you’ve found an error? (We are still human.) Please reach out at editorial@ccf.org .",

All from the comfort of home. Without the cost or hassle of travel. Virtual Second Opinions (VSO) by Cleveland Clinic is delivered by The Clinic , a joint venture between Cleveland Clinic and Amwell, a global leader in telehealth. But what’s a virtual second opinion? A second opinion is a way to get more information about a condition, treatment option or procedure from an expert — and when it’s virtual, you can do it all without leaving home. No travel time, record-collecting, or hunting down the best specialists needed. With virtual second opinions, you’ll be more informed and equipped to move forward. 67% of virtual second opinions recommend a change in diagnosis or treatment plan. When Should I Consider a Second Opinion? A second opinion can be a good option when you’re: Diagnosed with a serious condition. Told you need to have surgery or a procedure. Considering a possibly risky treatment. Experiencing a condition is changing and possibly getting worse. Confused about or struggling with a medical challenge. How do Virtual Second Opinions by Cleveland Clinic Work? 1. Registration and live intake visit with a nurse care manager: After you create an account through our secure portal, you’ll have a live video visit with your nurse care manager (U.S. only). They'll take it from there and get you on your path to peace of mind. 2. Records collection and expedited matching: The next step is all about getting the information we need to help you. With your consent, we do all the work of collecting your medical records and then match you with a Cleveland Clinic specialist in just a few days. We make this possible weeks sooner than it might be in-person. 3. Expert second opinion: Your second opinion will be delivered in a written report and an optional virtual visit with the Cleveland Clinic provider (virtual visit not available in all locations). View more: View less: When you receive your VSO it’ll be in a written report outlining your expert provider’s recommendations. Depending on your location, you may have the option to include a virtual visit (video or phone) with the Cleveland Clinic provider to review those recommendations.

              "content": "Advertisement Advertisement A bone marrow biopsy is a procedure that involves removing a sample of bone marrow and testing it for signs of disease. Your healthcare provider may perform a biopsy to diagnose blood disorders, cancer and many other conditions that may affect your bone marrow. The procedure lasts around 30 minutes and doesn’t usually involve a hospital stay. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Contents Arrow Down Overview Test Details Results and Follow-Up Overview The hip bone is the most common site to collect a bone marrow sample during a bone marrow biopsy. What is a bone marrow biopsy? A bone marrow biopsy is a procedure used to diagnose conditions affecting your blood and bone marrow. Your bone marrow is where your body’s blood cells get made. During the procedure, your healthcare provider removes a small sample of marrow from inside a bone. Afterward, a specialist called a pathologist examines the cells from the marrow under a microscope, looking for signs of disease. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Many conditions — including blood disorders and some cancers — require a bone marrow biopsy to confirm a suspected diagnosis. What is bone marrow? Bone marrow is located inside the hollow center of your larger bones. Bone marrow consists of soft, sponge-like tissue and a liquid. The tissue part of bone marrow produces: Red blood cells : Cells that carry oxygen throughout your body. White blood cells : Cells that protect your body from germs and infectious diseases . Platelets : Cells that form clots to stop bleeding when your blood vessels are damaged. Your blood vessels are tubes like arteries, veins and capillaries that circulate blood throughout your body. The liquid part of bone marrow contains stem cells, or maturing blood cells. It also makes vitamins needed for cell production. While a bone marrow biopsy tests the tissue part of your bone marrow, a separate procedure called a bone marrow aspiration tests the liquid portion. On the day of your procedure, your provider will likely perform a bone marrow aspiration immediately before the biopsy. When would a doctor order a bone marrow biopsy? A bone marrow biopsy provides valuable information your provider can use to: Evaluate or diagnose a condition: Your healthcare provider might order a bone marrow biopsy if they notice an abnormal number of blood cells in a blood sample. A biopsy can help them diagnose blood disorders, cancer, causes of unexplained fevers or infections and more. Stage cancer: Cancer staging measures how much cancer has progressed. A bone marrow biopsy can show if cancer has spread to your bone marrow. It can show if a tumor in your bone marrow is growing. Monitor treatment progress: Your provider may perform a bone marrow biopsy to see if treatment is working. For example, you may receive regular bone marrow biopsies if you receive cancer treatments. The results can show if your bone marrow produces enough healthy blood cells after treatment. Advertisement A bone marrow biopsy can also determine whether a donor is a good match for an allogeneic stem cell transplant. In some instances, a person with too few healthy blood cells may need new, healthy stem cells from a donor. For this to happen, the cells from the donor and recipient must match. What conditions and diseases are diagnosed with a bone marrow biopsy? Your provider may perform a bone marrow biopsy to diagnose conditions involving too many or too few blood cells. Bone marrow biopsies may also be used to diagnose cancers affecting your blood or bone marrow. Conditions include: Anemia: A condition that involves not having enough red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body. Aplastic anemia: A condition where your blood marrow can’t produce enough red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Leukopenia and leukocytosis: Conditions involving too few or too many white blood cells. Thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis : Conditions involving too few or too many platelets. Polycythemia vera : A rare blood cancer that causes your blood marrow to produce too many red blood cells. Leukemia : Cancer of your blood cells that can lead to abnormal blood cells, especially white blood cells. Lymphoma: Cancer of your lymphatic system that can lead to an abnormal number of white and red blood cells. Multiple myeloma : A rare blood cancer that harms your plasma cells. A plasma cell is a type of white blood cell. Secondary cancers: Cancer that starts elsewhere in your body (for example, breast cancer or lung cancer ) but then spreads to a secondary location, like your bone marrow. Myelofibrosis : A disorder involving fibrous scar tissue replacing bone marrow. Myelodysplastic syndrome: A bone marrow disorder in which stem cells don’t mature properly. A bone marrow biopsy can also detect abnormalities in chromosomes and vitamin deficiencies , which can trigger your bone marrow to produce red blood cells that are misshapen or too large. Who performs a bone marrow biopsy? A provider specializing in blood disorders (hematologist) or cancer (oncologist) may perform your bone marrow biopsy. Nurses who are specially trained in this procedure also perform bone marrow biopsies. Test Details How can I prepare for a bone marrow biopsy? Your provider will explain the procedure and instruct you on how to prepare. For instance, if you receive a sedative to help with the pain the day of the procedure, you may need to fast (no food or drink) the night before. You’ll need to arrange for someone to drive you home. Your provider should have detailed information about your medical history and current medications. Tell them about: Any history of bleeding disorders (such as hemophilia ). Any medications you’re taking, especially blood thinners ( anticoagulants ). Any vitamins or supplements you’re taking. Any medication allergies. Your provider will also need to know if you’re pregnant. What should I expect during a bone marrow biopsy? A bone marrow biopsy can occur in your healthcare provider’s office or hospital. The entire process lasts about 30 minutes. You’ll be awake during the procedure, but your provider will numb the biopsy site ( local anesthesia ) to keep you comfortable. Advertisement Before the procedure, you’ll change into a hospital gown. Your provider may give you a sedative to help you relax. Typically, the steps are as follows: Depending on the biopsy site, you’ll lie on your side or your belly. The most common bone marrow biopsy site is the back of your hip bone (posterior iliac crest). Your provider will clean your skin with an antiseptic and inject a numbing medication through your skin to the bone surface. They’ll make a small incision at the site and insert a special biopsy needle into your bone. They’ll use a small syringe attached to the needle to remove liquid from your bone marrow. This is called a bone marrow aspiration. They’ll insert a needle with a hollowed-out center to capture a small piece of the sponge-like tissue from your marrow. This type of biopsy is called a core biopsy because the needle removes a “core,” or cylinder-shaped, tissue sample. Your provider will remove the needle that contains the sample. They’ll apply pressure to your skin to stop any bleeding and place a bandage over the wound. Your provider will send the sample to a lab, where it can be examined for signs of disease. How painful is a bone marrow biopsy? You may feel a sharp sting during the bone marrow aspiration, and you may feel brief, dull pain during the core biopsy part of the procedure. Unfortunately, bone can’t be numbed. You may feel pressure, pushing and pulling that may cause discomfort. Advertisement Talk to your provider about any concerns you may have about pain. In addition to numbing the biopsy site, they can provide medications to keep you more comfortable during your biopsy. What should I expect after a bone marrow biopsy? You’ll likely go home the same day of your procedure. If you received a sedative during the biopsy, you’ll need someone to drive you. Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions about caring for yourself as you recover. They may advise you to: Take a nonprescription pain reliever to help with pain or discomfort. Avoid exercise or any strenuous physical activity for at least 24 hours. Keep your wound dry for at least 24 hours. Are there risks to a bone marrow biopsy? Complications, like heavy bleeding and infection at the biopsy site, are rare. Usually, applying pressure to the site stops excess bleeding. Your provider may prescribe an antibiotic cream if you get an infection. Results and Follow-Up What type of results do you get and what do the results mean? A specialist called a pathologist will analyze your bone marrow sample underneath a microscope. Your provider will review the pathologist’s findings and share next steps with you. Your provider may confirm a diagnosis, order more tests, or recommend or adjust treatments depending on your results. Ask your provider what your results mean for you. When should I call my doctor? Call your healthcare provider if you experience signs of a complication, including: Advertisement Heavy bleeding or drainage from the biopsy site. Swelling from the biopsy site. Redness (especially if it spreads). Fever or worsening pain. A note from Cleveland Clinic A bone marrow biopsy may be necessary if you have signs of a blood disorder or another condition involving your bone marrow. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have specific questions about the procedure or concerns about the sensations you may feel during a biopsy. They can provide pain medication to keep you comfortable and relaxed. They can also talk you through each step of the procedure so you feel more informed and confident on your biopsy day.

              "content": "Advertisement Advertisement Sex recorded at birth assigns a label — male or female — based on the appearance of your genitals at birth. In the U.S., this label goes on your birth certificate and your medical records. “Sex” is a shorthand way to refer to the arrangement of your chromosomes, the presence of sexual and reproductive organs, and your physical appearance. It provides information you and your healthcare provider can use to keep you healthy. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy What is sex recorded at birth (sex assigned at birth)? Your sex recorded at birth — sometimes called sex assigned at birth — has to do with your genitals. When a baby enters the world, a doctor or midwife inspects their genitals. If they see a penis , it means a male baby. It’s a boy! A vagina means a female baby. It’s a girl! And just like that, a baby's sex is recorded. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy In the U.S., sex is recorded on your birth certificate and in your medical records. Although an ultrasound can usually show the beginnings of a vulva or penis at 20 weeks, it’s not until you’re born that sex becomes a matter of public record. As you grow, those around you may abandon the more formal-sounding labels. For example, a baby whose recorded sex is female may grow into labels like young lady , woman , mom and grandma . These labels are less about your genitals at birth and more about how others view or relate to you. The way you view yourself may match these expectations, or it may not. Your experience of your body and how others perceive it, as well as your recorded sex, all matter to your health. This is why it’s essential to understand what your originally recorded sex may — and may not mean — for your care. What determines sex? Your assigned sex ( M or F ) keeps the biology simple. But in reality, sex isn’t just penises and vaginas. The science is more complex. Sex is the genetic instructions that tell an embryo which sexual organs to form. It’s the presence of hormones that act on sexual parts and even non-sexual ones. It’s things like your: Chromosomal sex . Chromosomes contain the instructions that tell your body how to develop. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. The 23rd pair determines your chromosomal sex. Males are XY and females are XX. Gonadal sex . Your gonads are your primary reproductive organs. The presence of ovaries means female, while testicles means male. These parts are important because they make the sex cells (eggs and sperm ) that allow reproduction to happen. They also produce sex hormones, like estrogen and testosterone . Phenotypic sex . Phenotypic sex includes all parts involved in male and female sexual anatomy. It also includes secondary sex characteristics that develop during puberty , like facial hair ( males ) and breasts ( females ). These changes happen thanks to a surge in sex hormones. Advertisement For most people, chromosomes, gonads and phenotype all match up as either male or female. But in every 1 in 1,000 to 4,500 births , these indicators of sex don’t align. Currently, there are 60 different known variations where genitals, chromosomes and hormones don’t clearly match up as either male or female. In that case, a healthcare provider delivering a baby may not be able to easily classify them as male or female. Or, genitals may look typically female or male, but internal organs or chromosomes don’t match the outside. Sometimes, there are hormone differences that affect phenotypic sex that don’t show up until puberty. How does sex recorded at birth relate to your health? Although the language we use to talk about sex isn’t always the best at describing complex human biology, it can still be useful. Depending on how it’s used, sex can help doctors talk about disease and wellness in general ways that can help you care for your body. Still, you should always discuss your individual care plan — tailored to your unique needs and biology — with your medical team. Specialty care The specialty care you need may depend on your sex. For example, obstetricians and gynecologists specialize in female sexual and reproductive health. Urologists , on the other hand, treat urinary conditions in everyone and sexual and reproductive issues in males, specifically. Among other things, endocrinologists help with issues related to sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen. Health screenings The screenings you need depend largely on your anatomy. For example, getting your first Pap , HPV test or mammogram is a rite of passage for most females. For males, that rite is often their first testicular or prostate exam . It’s important to know how your anatomy relates to your disease risk. That way, you can schedule screenings that make early diagnosis and treatment possible. Conditions Several conditions are sex-related. Both benign (noncancerous) conditions and cancer can affect your reproductive organs. This is why screenings are a must. With some conditions, the connection to sex is less obvious. For example, some genetic disorders that involve problems related to the X chromosome can affect you differently based on your chromosomal sex. These X-linked conditions often cause males (XY) to develop the disease (or the worst effects of it) while females (XX) experience less severe effects or just carry the gene for the disease. This is the case with conditions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy , hemophilia A and red-green color blindness . In this case, your sex at the cellular level not only matters to your health, but it also influences how likely it is that you’ll pass the condition along to your biological children. You may need to seek genetic counseling before trying to have a baby. Advertisement Some sex-related differences may increase or decrease your disease risk. For example, body composition (the distribution of fat and muscle) and hormones likely play a role in why males are at greater risk of heart disease . After menopause , when estrogen levels drop, females are about as likely to develop heart disease as males. And then there are conditions that seem to relate to sex, but scientists don’t know why. For instance, it’s unclear why females are more likely to get diagnosed with an autoimmune disease , while males are more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease or ALS . Symptoms Even when doctors don’t completely know why a condition is different based on your sex, it’s still useful to know about it. This can help you recognize symptoms as potentially serious. It can give you that nudge to call your healthcare provider. This is especially the case when your experience of a condition depends on your sex. Probably the most well-known example is heart attack symptoms. If you’re male, a heart attack often feels like chest pain or indigestion . If you’re female, it’s more likely to feel like shortness of breath , fatigue or pain in places other than your chest. Knowing how you may experience a condition based on your sex can keep you from dismissing a symptom as minor. It can potentially save your life. Advertisement Diagnostics and test results Most tests report normal results as falling within a range. This accounts for natural variations among individuals. But the ranges may be sex-specific if the values relate to things like sex hormones or your body size. Both of these things relate to your gonadal sex (ovaries or testicles) and sexual development during puberty. Two common values on routine blood work where there are sex differences are: Hemoglobin . The normal ranges of hemoglobin (the key ingredient in your red blood cells ) vary slightly based on whether you are male or female. Creatinine . What’s considered a healthy range for creatinine varies by sex. Creatinine levels provide clues about your kidney health. These are just two examples — there are many more. Wellness The advice that you get from your primary healthcare physician about how to stay healthy from day to day may include recommendations related to sex. Differences relate to things like your: Nutritional needs . How many calories you need per day and recommended nutrients may vary based on sex . And needs change depending on life events, like pregnancy and menopause. Exercise routine . While most adults need roughly the same amount of exercise daily , bodies respond differently to exercise, in part, because of your sex. For example, it’s generally easier for males to build muscle mass, thanks to high testosterone levels. The benefits of exercise also differ based on age. Alcohol consumption . Females have less of an enzyme that breaks down alcohol, which means they tolerate less of it than males. This is partly why recommendations for limiting alcohol intake differ by sex. Advertisement It’s important to remember, though, that sex is only one small factor that may guide your wellness routine. After all, your health goals likely tell you more about your nutritional needs than your sex. The way you’d like to feel in your body likely matters more to your exercise regimen than your sex organs do. What sex can’t tell you about your health Your sex can provide guidance on essential things, but there’s much that it can’t tell you. For example, most wellness advice, like how much sleep adults need each night, applies to everyone. And most diseases don’t seem to discriminate based on sex. Research shows that there may be connections among things like sex chromosomes, immune system function, and cancer risk and severity. But more research is needed to understand these relationships. It’s also difficult to tell how disease risk relates to your sex versus your environment. For instance, throat cancer is more common in males. But the primary risk factor for throat cancer is smoking . Since men smoke more than women, it’s possible that it’s the behavior and not the biology that leads to throat cancer. Finally, sex can’t tell you the complete story about how your health relates to your experience of who you are. If you’re having trouble sleeping at a time in your life when you’re caring for an aging parent, being female likely matters less than the stress you’re carrying. Your experience isn’t completely separate from sex, especially if one of the labels you grew into was loving child or devoted daughter . Research shows females are more likely to experience insomnia . But your genitals as a baby matter much less than your experience as a tired adult and loving caregiver. This is why it’s important to speak frankly with your healthcare provider about all the factors that matter to your health. A designation of male or female on your birth certificate provides a starting place to talk about the care you may need. The conversation should continue to address things like your unique biology, experience and health goals. It all matters when it comes to your health. A note from Cleveland Clinic Your sex recorded at birth provides a snapshot of the sexual organs your healthcare provider saw on the day you were born. It also provides a snapshot of your healthcare needs as you grow into adulthood. Those needs often change as bodies age and life circumstances evolve. Ask your healthcare provider about the care you need based on your sex. Be sure to ask about general recommendations to care for yourself as best as you can, no matter your sex.

Policy Contents Arrow Down What is Squamous Cell Carcinoma? Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Outlook / Prognosis Prevention Living With Additional Common Questions What is Squamous Cell Carcinoma? Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma. It starts in squamous cells in the outer layer of your skin, the epidermis . Usually, squamous cell carcinomas form on areas of your skin that receive the most sun exposure like your head, arms and legs. Cancer can also form in areas of your body where you have mucous membranes, which are the inner lining of your organs and body cavities like in your mouth, lungs and anus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy What are the types of squamous cell carcinoma? There are different types of squamous cell carcinoma based on where and how much cancer is in your body: Cutaneous : Cancer that only affects the top layer of your skin (in situ) or cancer that’s spread beyond the top layer of your skin. Metastatic : Cancer that’s spread to other parts of your body beyond your skin. Who does squamous cell carcinoma affect? Squamous cell carcinoma can affect anyone. You’re most at risk if you: Have long-term sun exposure or sun damage to your skin at a young age. Have a pale complexion, blue or green eyes, blonde or red hair. Are 65 years of age or older. Have a weak immune system or received an organ transplant. Had chemical exposure (cigarettes, arsenic). Males are about two times more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma. People over the age of 50 are most likely to get SCCs, but the incidence has been rising in people younger than 50. How common is squamous cell carcinoma? Over 1 million people receive a squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis in the U.S. each year. The rate of SCC has risen about 200% over the past 30 years. Symptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma? Symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma include skin changes like: A rough-feeling, bump or growth, which might crust over like a scab and bleed. A growth that’s higher than the skin around it but sinks down (depression) in the middle. A wound or sore that won’t heal, or a sore that heals and then comes back. An area of skin that’s flat, scaly and red that’s larger, about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). Advertisement What are the signs of squamous cell carcinoma? There are cancerous bumps, marks or lesions that form on your skin that can be a sign of squamous cell carcinoma, including: A bump or lump that can feel dry, itchy, scaly or have a different color from the skin around it ( actinic keratosis ). A lesion on your lower lip where the tissue becomes pale, dry and cracked ( cheilitis ). This may have a burning sensation when you’re exposed to the sun. White or pale spots in your mouth, on your tongue, gums or cheeks ( leukoplakia ). Where on my body can I get squamous cell carcinoma? You can have squamous cell carcinoma on any part of your body, but it’s most common on your: Skin. Mouth, tongue and throat (oral carcinoma). Face, lips, nose, ears , eyelids and scalp . Stomach ( esophageal or epidermoid carcinoma). Hands, arms and legs. Anal cavity. What causes squamous cell carcinoma? A mutation to the p53 gene causes squamous cell carcinoma. The most common way that your p53 gene mutates is from ultraviolet (UV) exposure from the sun, or from using indoor tanning beds. The p53 gene provides instructions for your cells to divide and replicate to replace cells when they reach the end of their lifespan. Your p53 gene is a tumor suppressor, which means that the gene controls how much and how often your cells should create new cells. Too many cells create tumors, which can be cancerous. A mutation to the p53 gene means that your cells don’t have the instructions they need to do their job correctly. As a result, your squamous cells divide and replicate too often, causing tumors (bumps, lumps or lesions) to form in and on your body. Does squamous cell carcinoma spread? Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma rarely spreads to other parts of your body (metastasize). If this does happen, it occurs slowly and can be life-threatening if left untreated. If you notice changes to your skin, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Diagnosis and Tests How is squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will physically examine the area of your body where you have symptoms, looking specifically at the size, shape and location of the lump or lesion. Your healthcare provider will also ask questions to learn more about your medical history and your symptoms, which could include: When did you notice the lump or lesion on your skin? Did this lump change in size from when you first noticed symptoms? Is it painful or itchy? What tests diagnose squamous cell carcinoma? After your physical exam, your healthcare provider might offer tests to confirm a diagnosis, which could include: Skin biopsy : Removing a small sample of the affected tissue to examine it under a microscope. Imaging tests ( CT scan or MRI ) : Your healthcare provider will use an imaging test to identify the size of your carcinoma underneath your skin and to see if it spread to other parts of your body, especially your lymph nodes. Advertisement What are the stages of squamous cell carcinoma? Your healthcare provider will assign a stage to your diagnosis to identify how much cancer is in your body. Stages help them choose the treatment that’s right for you. There are five stages of squamous cell carcinoma: Stage 0: Cancer is only in the top layer of your skin (epidermis). This is also called squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Stage I (1): Cancer is in the top and middle layers of your skin (epidermis and dermis ). Stage II (2): Cancer is in the top and middle layers of your skin and moves to target your nerves or deeper layers of skin (epidermis, dermis and subcutis). Stage III (3): Cancer has spread beyond your skin to your lymph nodes. Stage IIIV (4): Cancer has spread to other parts of your body and your organs like your liver, lungs or brain. Management and Treatment How is squamous cell carcinoma treated? Treatment for squamous cell carcinoma focuses on removing cancer from your body. Your treatment options vary based on the size, shape and location of your cancer and could include: Cryosurgery : Freezing the cancer cells to destroy them. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) : Using blue light and light-sensitive agents to remove cancer from your skin. Curettage and electrodesiccation : Scratching off the cancerous lump with a spoon-like instrument (curette), then burning the area with an electric needle. Excision : Cutting the cancer out of your skin and stitching your skin back together. Mohs surgery : Removing layers of skin affected by cancer, most common for facial cancers. Systemic chemotherapy : Using powerful medicines to destroy cancer cells in your body. Advertisement What medications treat squamous cell carcinoma? If you have invasive squamous cell carcinoma or if treatment to remove your cancer surgically isn’t right for you, your healthcare provider could offer medicine to treat your diagnosis. Medicines could include: Skin creams containing imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil help treat squamous cell carcinoma that’s in the top layer of your skin (epidermis). Cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo®) is immunotherapy to treat advanced forms of squamous cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) is immunotherapy to treat squamous cell carcinoma that isn’t treatable with surgery. What are the side effects of the treatments for squamous cell carcinoma? The most common side effect of squamous cell carcinoma treatment is cosmetic changes to your skin, like scarring, after your healthcare provider removes the cancer from your body. If you take immunotherapy drugs to treat your cancer, talk to your healthcare provider about the side effects of the drugs. How soon after treatment will I feel better? The amount of time your body needs to heal after treatment varies for each person. The size shape and location also affect your healing time after treatment. On average, most people will recover within two to four weeks after treatment to remove cancer from their body. Your healthcare provider will meet with you a few weeks after treatment to make sure your body is healing properly and to make sure treatment was successful at removing cancer. Advertisement Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have squamous cell carcinoma? Most cases of squamous cell carcinoma have a positive prognosis and an excellent survival rate if you receive an early diagnosis. Early detection and treatment prevent the tumor from growing and damaging other parts of your body. If your healthcare provider removes your cancer, there’s a chance it can return in the future. Make sure to follow up with your healthcare provider to verify you’re cancer-free. It’s also important to protect your skin from UV rays when outdoors. Prevention How can I prevent squamous cell carcinoma? While you can’t prevent all types of squamous cell carcinoma, you can take steps to reduce your risk by: Avoiding excessive sun exposure. Avoid using tanning beds. Using sunscreen when you’re outdoors. Wearing protective clothing and accessories from the sun, including sunglasses, hats and clothing with UPF protection. Stopping smoking. Avoid exposing yourself to chemicals without wearing personal protective equipment. If you notice changes to your skin, contact your healthcare provider or visit a dermatologist for a professional skin exam. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? Contact your healthcare provider if: You have any skin changes that worry you, including a new lump, mole or a sore that doesn’t heal, or changes to a mole or spot you’ve had for some time. You need to schedule your annual skin check appointment with your dermatologist. You have any side effects or complications related to your treatment for squamous cell carcinoma, like pain, bleeding or itching. What questions should I ask my doctor? What stage of squamous cell carcinoma do I have? Do I need surgery to remove cancer from my body? Do I need to see a dermatologist? Are there side effects to the treatment? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma? Both squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are types of skin cancer that you can get from too much sun (ultraviolet ray) exposure. An overproduction of either squamous or basal cells causes both conditions. Squamous cell carcinomas can form on your skin (epidermis) in the same way BCC does, but SCC can also form where you have mucus membranes on your body, which includes the inside of your mouth, throat, lungs and genitals. What is squamous cell carcinoma in situ? Squamous cell carcinoma in situ is also known as Bowen disease. The term “in situ” means that the cancer cells are only in the top layer of your skin (epidermis). The most common places to find Bowen disease is on sun-exposed areas of your skin, but the condition can also appear on the skin near your anal cavity and genitals, like on your labia or vulva (vulvar cancer). A note from Cleveland Clinic It can be scary finding a new lump on your skin that leads to a cancer diagnosis. But treatment for squamous cell carcinoma is effective at removing cancer from your body. Take steps to prevent squamous cell carcinoma by protecting yourself from the sun’s UV rays. Call your healthcare provider if you find any new lumps or bumps on your skin, and get them examined and treated immediately. Medically Reviewed Last reviewed on 04/15/2022.

              "content": "Advertisement Advertisement Marfan syndrome affects the connective tissue that holds your body together. Since the syndrome affects various parts of your body, you’ll need a team of healthcare providers to manage it. Close monitoring and treatments can help you live a healthy life. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Contents Arrow Down What Is Marfan Syndrome? Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Outlook / Prognosis What Is Marfan Syndrome? Many people with Marfan syndrome develop changes in their heart and blood vessels. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic condition that makes your connective tissue too loose and elastic. Connective tissue typically provides strength and flexibility to many structures in your body. Because of this, Marfan syndrome can affect several body systems, including your heart, blood vessels , eyes, bones and joints . Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Healthcare providers call Marfan syndrome a “variable expression” genetic condition. This means not everyone has the same symptoms. The signs and symptoms vary widely in severity and when they start. Marfan syndrome is present at birth. But you may not get a diagnosis until you’re a teen or young adult. It’s one of the most common inherited connective tissue diseases, affecting 1 in 3,000 to 5,000 people. That’s 0.02% to 0.03% of people. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of Marfan syndrome The two main features of Marfan syndrome are aortic root aneurysm (widening or bulging of your aorta near your aortic valve) and dislocated eye lens ( ectopia lentis ). These two issues can lead to symptoms like: A heartbeat that feels like it’s skipping a beat or fluttering (heart palpitations) A heartbeat that feels too hard or too fast Eye pain Shortness of breath Vision changes, like astigmatism and extreme nearsightedness But Marfan syndrome can affect several other parts of your body, causing other symptoms. For example, physical features of Marfan syndrome may include: A long, narrow face Arms, legs, fingers and toes that seem too long for the rest of your body Crowded teeth Curved spine (scoliosis) Flat feet Joints that are weak and easily become dislocated Stretch marks, even without weight changes Sunken chest ( pectus excavatum ) or protruding chest ( pectus carinatum ) Tall and thin body build Advertisement Complications of this condition Marfan syndrome can cause several complications affecting your heart, eyes and lungs. Cardiovascular complications are the most common complications of Marfan syndrome (MFS). They can include: Aortic dissection . This is a tear in the inner layer of your aorta’s wall. Heart valve disease . MFS can cause valve tissue to become weak and stretch. Enlarged heart . Your heart muscle may enlarge and weaken over time. Arrhythmia . An abnormal heart rhythm in MFS is often related to mitral valve prolapse . Brain aneurysms . This is a bulge in a weak area of a blood vessel in or around your brain. Eye complications may include: Cataracts Glaucoma Retinal detachment The changes in lung tissue that occur with MFS increase your risk for: Asthma Bronchitis Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Collapsed lung (pneumothorax) Emphysema Pneumonia What causes Marfan syndrome? A genetic change (variant) causes Marfan syndrome. More specifically, there’s a change in the gene — fibrillin-1 or FBN1 — that gives your cells instructions to make fibrillin. Fibrillin is a protein that’s the main component of elastic fibers in your connective tissue. In most cases, you inherit Marfan syndrome from a biological parent. The syndrome has an autosomal dominant inheritance . This means you only need to receive the altered gene from one parent to inherit the condition. People with Marfan syndrome have a 50% chance of passing on the disorder to each of their children. In 25% of Marfan syndrome cases, a new gene change occurs due to an unknown cause. Diagnosis and Tests How doctors diagnose Marfan syndrome Marfan syndrome can affect tissues all over your body. So, you may need a team of healthcare providers to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. To start, they’ll: Ask about your medical history Do a physical exam to look for typical signs of the syndrome Ask about your symptoms Ask about biological family members who may have had health problems related to MFS Healthcare providers typically use a set of criteria to diagnose MFS called the Ghent nosology. They may recommend many tests to help confirm the diagnosis or rule out other conditions, like: Computed tomography (CT) scan Chest X-ray Electrocardiogram Echocardiogram Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) A genetic test (blood test) can look for changes in FBN1 , the gene that’s responsible for most cases of Marfan syndrome. But the results of genetic tests for Marfan syndrome aren’t always clear. This test can also look for other genetic conditions, like Loeys-Dietz syndrome , that cause similar symptoms. Management and Treatment How is Marfan syndrome treated? There’s no cure for Marfan syndrome. But various treatments and strategies can help manage your symptoms and prevent complications, like: Medications Routine monitoring Physical activity guidance Surgery Advertisement You’ll need a treatment plan that’s specific to your health issues. Medications Certain medications can help prevent or manage complications, including: Beta-blockers . Beta-blockers prevent or slow down the enlargement of your aorta. Healthcare providers recommend beta-blocker therapy at an early age for MFS. If you can’t take them because of asthma or side effects, your provider can prescribe a calcium channel blocker . Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) . ARBs may also slow the rate of aorta enlargement in people with MFS. If you get heart valve surgery for MFS, you’ll need to be on an anticoagulant medication for the rest of your life. Monitoring You’ll need routine medical appointments to monitor your: Heart and blood vessels — in particular, the size of your aorta Eyes Skeletal system This way, your healthcare team can track changes and catch any possible complications as soon as they appear. Your team will tell you how often you need these appointments. Monitoring for MFS usually involves imaging tests, like: CT scans Echocardiograms MRI scans Physical activity guidance Intense physical activity can strain your aorta and other connective tissues impacted by MFS. Because of this, you’ll work closely with a physical therapist to find exercises and sports that are safe for you. Advertisement Providers generally recommend low- to moderate-intensity exercise for most people with MFS. But you may need less if you have aortic root or valve replacement. In general, you’ll likely need to avoid: Activities involving the Valsalva maneuver Contact sports Exercise to exhaustion Isometric exercises , like planks and wall sits Heart surgery The goal of heart surgery for Marfan syndrome is to prevent your aorta from dissecting or rupturing and to treat valve problems. Together, you and your healthcare team will decide if surgery is right for you based on several factors. The most common surgeries and procedures for MFS include: Aortic valve repair or replacement Ascending aortic aneurysm repair Mitral valve repair or replacement Thoracic endovascular aortic repair If you need surgery, you should aim to choose a major health system that’s experienced in the type of surgery you’re getting. Your surgical team should be familiar with Marfan syndrome, as well. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have Marfan syndrome? If you have Marfan syndrome, you can expect a lot of medical appointments and needing to have a thorough understanding of your body. MFS affects everyone differently, so you’ll have your own journey with the syndrome. You’ll work closely with your team of healthcare providers to manage MFS as it changes. Advertisement Due to increased knowledge of MFS and advanced medical treatments, people with MFS live much longer than they did before the 1970s. The life expectancy of someone with MFS is now almost the same as it is for people without MFS. But life expectancy is significantly lower in males than in females. Cardiovascular impairment is still the most common cause of death in MFS. This is mainly due to sudden death in undiagnosed cases of MFS. It’s also more likely to affect people who get a late MFS diagnosis. MFS and mental health Several aspects of living with Marfan syndrome can impact your mental health and quality of life, like: The chronic nature of MFS and the need for lifelong treatment The ways MFS affects your appearance Chronic pain and fatigue Limits on physical activity, which are often social interactions Family planning stressors Because of this, you may be at higher risk of: Anxiety Depression Experiencing bullying Social isolation Caregivers and family members of people with MFS are also at risk of these mental health issues. Be sure to seek help from a mental health specialist (like a psychologist ) if you’re experiencing distress related to MFS. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Joining a support group may also help. A note from Cleveland Clinic Life with Marfan syndrome may feel like spinning through a revolving door of medical appointments, treatments and lifestyle changes. But all those check-ins can help prevent complications of Marfan syndrome so you can live the healthiest life possible. Your healthcare team will be by your side through it all. Lean on them for support and guidance. If you’re becoming overwhelmed, reach out to a mental health specialist for help. Medically Reviewed Last reviewed on 03/27/2025.
