  "content": "Court Role and Structure Article III of the U.S. Constitution establishes the judicial branch as one of the three separate and distinct branches of the federal government. These three branches — legislative, executive, and judicial — operate within a constitutional system of “checks and balances.” This means that although each branch is formally separate from the other two, the Constitution often requires cooperation among the branches. Federal laws, for example, are passed by Congress and signed by the President. The judicial branch, in turn, has the authority to decide the constitutionality of federal laws and resolve other cases involving federal laws. But judges depend upon the executive branch to enforce court decisions. Courts provide a peaceful way to decide private disputes that people can’t resolve themselves. Depending on the dispute or crime, some cases end up in the federal courts and some end up in state courts. Learn about the difference between federal and state courts . Supreme Court The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States.

      "content": "Evidence-Based Practices Probation and pretrial services officers are committed to using evidence-based practices (EBP) to promote public safety and positively impact the lives of people on supervision. What are Evidence-Based Practices? Evidence-based practices involve the conscientious application of social science research and other available data to inform policies and practices that aim to achieve maximum and measurable reductions in recidivism. The Risk-Need-Responsivity Model is used to guide effective assessment and supervision practices in the federal system. The Risk-Need-Responsivity Model The foundation of effective supervision in the federal system is an officer’s ability to understand an individual’s risk of committing future crimes and to understand the areas of an individual’s life that, with intervention, can decrease the risk. Research demonstrates that using risk to guide decision-making improves outcomes. The Risk Principle Officers can have the greatest positive impact when they focus their time and resources on higher risk people on supervision and expend fewer resources on lower risk individuals. To assess risk, officers use a scientific tool called the Pretrial Risk Assessment (PTRA) to predict a defendant’s risk of failing to appear in court or committing new crimes or technical violations while awaiting trial. To assess risk for people on post-conviction supervision, officers use a scientific tool called the Post Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA) to predict an individual’s risk of re-offense and to identify issues that require intervention. Individuals who score higher on risk assessments generally require more intensive services. Those with lower scores may require less attention and may have limited involvement with the court or probation officer. By considering each person’s risk level, officers avoid over-supervising lower risk individuals, and they can focus their time and resources on people who need the most support. The Need Principle Interventions are most successful when they are tailored to factors specifically tied to criminality, such as cognitions (patterns of thinking), substance use, and associations and activities related to criminal behavior. Officers are trained to address factors tied to risk when recommending special conditions for release and when interacting with people on supervision. Officers rely on data from the pretrial interview, charging documents, interviews, and other sources to make a determination of an individual’s risk level and needs. For example, special conditions requiring drug testing and treatment might be recommended for someone with a history of drug use. Officers also discuss with the individual the people, places, and situations that may negatively affect their risk and stability in the community. The Responsivity Principle Interventions are more effective when they focus on reducing barriers specific to an individual’s unique circumstances or characteristics. For example, someone may fail to attend court ordered treatment because of a lack of motivation. Or they may face other barriers such as a lack of transportation, childcare, or housing. Officers work with individuals to address responsivity factors and reduce barriers. They also coordinate or partner with public and community resources to provide needed services. The challenge of using data and research to guide decision-making in the field is explained by federal officers in this brief video. Officers describe how research done by social scientists is used to devise strategies for individual clients, strategies that can be effective in changing lives. “We are listening to the research a lot more,” one officer says. Evidence-Based Supervision Throughout an individual’s term of supervision, officers conduct an ongoing assessment of risk, need, and responsivity and develop individualized supervision strategies that promote success. The supervision process is dynamic. Officers use a set of skills, known as core correctional practices, to increase motivation and target factors tied to criminality. Core Correctional Practices are skills or techniques that aim to reduce the risk of recidivism. They include relationship building skills, techniques to change criminal thought patterns, the effective use of reinforcement and disapproval to influence behavior, and helping individuals develop social skills and problem-solving abilities.

              "content": "Defender Services CJA Panel Attorney Funds Information for FY 2025 With the passage of a continuing resolution through Jan. 30, 2026, Criminal Justice Act payments may now be processed. Keep updated on this evolving situation . The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the right to representation by counsel in serious criminal prosecutions. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the right to representation by counsel in serious criminal prosecutions. The responsibility for appointing counsel in federal criminal proceedings for those unable to bear the cost of representation has historically rested in the federal judiciary. Before the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA), however, there was no authority to compensate appointed counsel for their services or litigation expenses, and federal judges depended on the professional obligation of lawyers to provide pro bono publico representation to defendants unable to retain counsel. In 1964, the CJA was enacted to establish a comprehensive system for appointing and compensating lawyers to represent defendants financially unable to retain counsel in federal criminal proceedings. The CJA authorized reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and payment of expert and investigative services necessary for an adequate defense. While it provided for some compensation for appointed counsel (CJA panel attorneys), it did so at rates substantially below that which they would receive from their privately-retained clients. In 1970, the CJA was amended to authorize districts to establish federal defender organizations as counterparts to federal prosecutors in U.S. Attorneys Offices and an institutional resource for providing defense counsel in those districts (or combinations of adjacent districts) where at least 200 persons annually require appointment of counsel. Today, there are 82 authorized federal defender organizations. They employ more than 3,700 lawyers, investigators, paralegals, and support personnel and serve 92 of the 94 federal judicial districts. There are two types of federal defender organizations: federal public defender organizations and community defender organizations. Federal defender organizations, together with the more than 12,000 private \"panel attorneys\" who accept CJA assignments annually, represent the vast majority of individuals who are prosecuted in our nation's federal courts. CJA panel attorneys accept appointments in all CJA cases in the four districts not served by a federal defender organization. In those districts with a defender organization, panel attorneys are typically assigned between 30 percent and 40 percent of the CJA cases, generally those where a conflict of interest or some other factor precludes federal defender representation. Nationwide, federal defenders receive approximately 60 percent of CJA appointments, and the remaining 40 percent are assigned to the CJA panel. Today, panel attorneys are paid an hourly rate of $175 in non-capital cases, and, in capital cases, a maximum hourly rate of $223. These rates are effective for work performed on or after January 1, 2025. The rates include both attorney compensation and office overhead. Compensation beyond statutory thresholds requires approval from the chief judge of the circuit or their delegate, depending on the category of representation (for example, $13,600 for felonies, $3,900 for misdemeanors, and $9,700 for appeals). Federal Public Defender Organizations Federal public defender organizations are federal entities, and their staffs are federal employees. The chief federal public defender is appointed to a four-year term by the court of appeals of the circuit in which the organization is located. The Congress placed this appointment authority in the court of appeals rather than the district court in order to insulate, as best as possible, the federal public defender from the involvement of the court before which the defender principally practices. Community Defender Organizations Community defender organizations are non-profit defense counsel organizations incorporated under state laws. When designated in the CJA plan for the district in which they operate, community defender organizations receive initial and sustaining grants from the federal judiciary to fund their operations. Community defender organizations operate under the supervision of a board of directors and may be a branch or division of a parent non-profit legal services corporation that provides representation to the poor in state, county, and municipal courts. The Judicial Conference of the United States promulgates policies and guidelines for the administration of the CJA, formulates legislative recommendations to the Congress, and approves funding requests and spending plans for the defender program as a whole and, through its standing Committee on Defender Services, budgets and grants for each defender organization. The policies and procedures of the Judicial Conference for the operation of the CJA are set forth in its Guidelines for Administering the CJA and Related Statutes . Acting under the supervision and direction of the Judicial Conference, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts oversees the expenditure of funds appropriated by Congress; administers the federal defender and panel attorney program on a national basis; is responsible for training related to furnishing representation under the CJA; and provides legal, policy, management, and fiscal advice to the Conference and its committees, judges, defenders and their staffs, and panel attorneys. Program support for the CJA is provided by the Defender Services Office of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. CJA Panel Attorneys Criminal Justice Act (CJA) panel attorneys are highly qualified, private attorneys who are appointed by the federal court to represent indigent defendants in criminal cases. These lawyers play a critical role in protecting a defendant’s constitutional rights, including their right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Panel attorneys are paid at the statutory maximum hourly rate for their time, and use court funds to hire investigators, interpreters, and other necessary experts to prepare a defense. Panel attorneys also have access to AO’s Defender Services Office training and legal resources to ensure they can provide high-quality representation to CJA clients. Federal defender organizations also provide training and support for their local panel attorneys. To learn how to apply to the CJA panel in your district, speak to a CJA panel attorney or visit the website of the local federal district court or federal defender organization.

They make a positive difference in the communities they serve. U.S. Probation and Pretrial Officers from around the country talk about their roles in the administration of justice. Our Mission U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services is a national system with a shared mission and professional identity and common goals and values. The system facilitates the fair administration of justice, enhances public safety, and positively impacts the lives of individuals who become involved with the federal courts. Officers accomplish their mission using data and evidence-based practices, which informs decision-making and operations across the system. Each office achieves success through interdependence, collaboration, and local innovation. Officers are committed to excellence and the principles outlined in their charter (pdf).

Probation and pretrial services officers are considered the eyes and ears of the federal courts. They investigate and supervise people charged with or convicted of federal crimes. Officers: Conduct investigations to assist judges in making decisions related to pretrial release and sentencing. Use the best available evidence to inform release and detention decisions and supervision practices to reduce risk to public safety and to promote long-term positive change in people’s lives. Support reentry of individuals released to the community, helping them transition to productive lives by assisting with emergency or transitional housing, substance use disorder and mental health treatment, training for employment, and other necessities. This short animation demonstrates how pretrial services and probation officers assist a defendant named Sam through the various stages of a federal criminal case. Leadership and Organization The U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services system is decentralized, with operations in all 94 federal court districts. In some districts, probation and pretrial services are separate offices while in others they are combined. In each district, the probation and pretrial services office provides vital services for the duration of a case. March 4, 2025, marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the Probation Act of 1925, which established a probation system in the federal courts. Officers working in pretrial services assist the courts with decisions while defendants are awaiting trial. Officers conducting presentence investigations provide judges with the information they need to make informed sentencing decisions. Officers working in post-conviction supervision help individuals live productive, crime-free lives after conviction or release from prison. The Judicial Conference of the United States sets policy for the federal probation and pretrial services system. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts supports implementation of national policy and establishes procedures to guide the system. History The U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services system has a rich history dating to the signing of the Probation Act of 1925 by President Calvin Coolidge. Return to top",

              "content": "Probation and Pretrial Services History The Power to Suspend Sentences Although many states had passed probation laws, beginning with Massachusetts in 1878, probation was not established at the federal level until much later. For many years the federal courts had used a form of probation through suspending sentences. Increasingly, however, the U.S. Department of Justice disapproved of the use of the suspended sentence, believing that it infringed upon executive pardoning power and therefore was unconstitutional. The matter came before the Supreme Court in Ex parte United States , 242 U.S. 27. In what became known as the Killits decision, the Supreme Court in 1916 held that federal courts did not have the power to suspend sentence indefinitely and that there was no reason or right for the courts to continue the practice. The Supreme Court suggested probation legislation as a remedy. A Controversial Sentencing Option Establishing probation as a sentencing option in the federal courts did not happen quickly or easily. Opinion on the wisdom of doing so was sharply divided. Some federal judges were for probation, seeing it as an alternative to the sometimes harsh penalties they were compelled to impose. Other federal judges were against probation, finding it too lenient. Congress could not reach agreement on a national plan. The first bills for a federal probation law had been introduced in Congress in 1909. But it was not until 1925--and after more than 30 bills had been introduced--that one such bill became law. March 4, 2025, marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the Probation Act of 1925, which established a probation system in the federal courts. Probation Act of 1925 The Probation Act of 1925, signed by President Calvin Coolidge, provided for a probation system in the federal courts (except in the District of Columbia). It gave the courts the power to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place defendants on probation for such period and on such terms and conditions as they deemed best. The Act also authorized courts to appoint one or more persons to serve as probation officers without compensation and one salaried probation officer. Administration in the Early Years Initially, the administration of federal probation was the responsibility of the Office of the Attorney General in the U.S. Department of Justice. Direct supervision fell to the superintendent of prisons, who was also in charge of prison industries and parole. In effect, federal probation officers answered to two authorities. Although the Attorney General set their salaries and provided for expenses such as clerical services and travel, judges appointed them. This arrangement changed in 1940, when general oversight of the probation system was transferred from the Federal Bureau of Prisons to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Pretrial Services as an Experiment In 1974 Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act. Title II of the Act authorized the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to establish \"demonstration\" pretrial services agencies in 10 judicial districts. The goal was to reduce crime by persons released to the community pending trial and to reduce unnecessary pretrial detention. The agencies were to interview each person charged with other than a petty offense, verify background information, and present a report to the judicial officer considering bail. The agencies also were to supervise persons released to their custody pending trial and to help defendants on bail locate and use community services. Five of the agencies were administered by the Administrative Office and five by boards of trustees appointed by the chief judges of the district courts. Beginnings of Probation and Pretrial Services Pretrial Services Act of 1982 President Ronald Reagan signed the Pretrial Services Act of 1982. The Act authorized expansion of pretrial services from the ten demonstration districts to every federal judicial district (except the District of Columbia). It granted an 18-month evaluation period for each court to decide whether to establish separate pretrial services offices or provide pretrial services through the probation office. Consequently, each court chose the form of pretrial services organization that best met its needs, considering such factors as criminal caseload and court locations. Expanding pretrial services to all districts marked a significant milestone for what was now the \"federal probation and pretrial services system.\" Now officers were involved in the criminal justice process from the time a person was arrested on a federal charge until he or she completed community supervision. Probation and Pretrial Services Milestones 1925 President Calvin Coolidge signs the Probation Act of 1925, establishing probation as a sentence in the federal courts. 1927 The first federal probation officer, Richard McSweeney, is appointed in the District of Massachusetts. 1930 Congress creates the National Parole Board and amends the Probation Act to give officers responsibility to supervise federal parolees. 1937 The first issue of the scholarly journal Federal Probation is published. 1943 The first policy monograph, The Presentence Investigation Report , tells officers how to conduct presentence investigations and prepare reports. 1946 Officers take on the duty of investigating the parole plans of Army and Air Force prisoners and supervising them following release from disciplinary barracks. 1950 A national training center is established in Chicago to provide officers with orientation and refresher training. 1955 Officers form their own professional organization, the Federal Probation and Pretrial Officers Association . 1963 The Judicial Conference of the United States forms a permanent committee—the Committee on the Administration of the Probation System—expressly to address probation system issues. 1975 Pretrial services agencies are established as an experiment in ten districts. The Judicial Conference of the United States adopts a policy that allows each district court to decide whether officers carry firearms. Early policies discouraged officers from carrying firearms and suggested that doing so was inconsistent with probation work--that in supervising individuals, officers assumed a helping role, not a law enforcement one. In the 1970's, however, the Judicial Conference began to see circumstances in which arming officers might be prudent. The 1975 policy statement still presumed that officers should not be armed--unless their assignments subjected them to serious risk of physical harm. A decade passed before the Judicial Conference addressed the matter of firearms training. In 1987, in two-week training sessions held in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Galveston, Texas, the system's first firearms instructors were trained to teach firearms handling and safety in their respective districts. 1978 Congress gives the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts the authority to provide contract aftercare treatment services to drug-dependent persons under probation system supervision. Before this time, the Attorney General had the authority to provide specialized programs and community aftercare for all drug-dependent defendants and offenders. In 1979, the Administrative Office began administering the national Substance Abuse Treatment Program to guide officers in identifying and treating substance abusers under their supervision. Substance abuse specialist positions were created in 1983 to provide intensive supervision to substance abusers. In 1986 and 1987, Congress expanded the Director’s contract authority to include services for alcohol-dependent offenders and offenders requiring psychiatric treatment. 1982 President Ronald Reagan signs the Pretrial Services Act, which authorizes expansion of pretrial services to each district court. 1984 The Bail Reform Act allows judges to consider danger to the community as a factor in deciding whether to release or detain persons awaiting trial. The Bail Reform Act radically changed the pretrial process in that it permitted courts to detain dangerous defendants. Previously, courts did not consider danger to the community in deciding whether to release or detain persons awaiting trial. This new development increased the number of persons detained to such an extent that, within a few years, the nation faced a national pretrial detention crisis. The increase in detention rates affected where defendants were housed while awaiting trial and when trials were scheduled. It hampered access to defendants by pretrial services officers and other parties in the criminal justice process. As a result of the situation, the Judicial Conference of the United States implored Congress to provide sufficient funding for adequate housing and supervision of pretrial detainees and encouraged use of alternatives to incarceration for some defendants, including community supervision and home confinement. 1986 The Sentencing Reform Act fundamentally changes the sentencing process in the federal courts. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was passed in response to congressional concern about fairness in sentencing. The Act completely changed the way courts sentenced federal offenders. The Act created a new federal agency, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, to set sentencing guidelines for every federal offense. When federal sentencing guidelines went into effect on November 1, 1987, they significantly altered judges’ sentencing discretion, officers’ preparation of the presentence investigation report, and officers’ overall role in the sentencing process. The new sentencing scheme also placed officers in a more adversarial environment in the courtroom, where attorneys might dispute facts, question guideline calculations, and object to the information in the presentence report. In addition to providing for a new sentencing process, the Act also replaced parole with \"supervised release,\" a term of community supervision to be served by prisoners after they completed prison terms. 1986 U.S. Probation Officer Thomas Gahl (Southern District of Indiana) is killed in the line of duty. On September 22, 1986, U.S. Probation Officer Thomas Gahl was slain by a mentally ill parolee under his supervision. Officer Gahl, who was 38 years old, was gunned down during a routine home visit. His death–the first and, to date, the only, officer line-of-duty death in the system–underscored the risks inherent in supervising an increasingly dangerous offender population and the critical importance of officer safety training. 1986 The home confinement program is launched in the federal courts. The Special Curfew Program was the federal courts’ first use of home confinement. It was part of an experimental program–a cooperative venture of the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Parole Commission, and the federal probation system–as an alternative to Bureau of Prisons Community Treatment Center (CTC) residence for eligible inmates. These inmates, instead of CTC placement, received parole dates advanced a maximum of 60 days and were subject to a curfew and minimum weekly contact with a probation officer. Electronic monitoring became part of the home confinement program several years later. In 1988, a pilot program was launched in two districts to evaluate the use of electronic equipment to monitor persons in the curfew program. The program was expanded nationally in 1991 and grew to include offenders on probation and supervised release and defendants on pretrial supervision as those who may be eligible to be placed on home confinement with electronic monitoring. 1989 Probation officers begin to receive for supervision persons sentenced to serve a term of supervised release. Phasing out parole and tightening sentencing requirements changed community supervision. The introduction of supervised release and increases in drug prosecutions and other serious cases caused a shift away from probation cases. As a result, most persons who came under supervision of federal probation officers had not been sentenced to probation, but sentenced to prison terms to be followed by community supervision. 1999 The Judicial Conference of the United States adopts a policy requiring updated background investigations for officers and officer assistants. 2000 The Judicial Conference of the United States adopts a workplace drug testing program for officers and officer assistants and a zero tolerance policy for the use of controlled substances. 2001 Officers take on responsibility to obtain DNA samples from persons under their supervision who have been convicted of certain crimes. 2002 The Judicial Conference of the United States adopts medical requirements and guidelines for officers and officer assistants. 2005 A national training academy for new officers is established at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Charleston, South Carolina. In partnership with FLETC, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts launched a national training academy for officers. The academy provided the means to offer new officers training as soon as possible after they were appointed by their courts and to provide them with comprehensive and uniform training. In addition to new officers, the academy offered an ideal environment for training officers who served as firearms and safety instructors in their districts. Pretrial Services Timeline This chronology is meant to highlight the most significant legislative and legal changes to the federal bail system. These changes have been made in response to academic research, public outcry, and evolving legal interpretations that have altered the manner in which the U.S. Government ensures that the rights of all criminal defendants are preserved. Of course, this list cannot detail every event that has altered the manner in which bail has changed. Instead, the focus of this timeline provides evidence that governmental actors must maintain high levels of accountability and transparency through reliance on evidence-based practice. Additionally, this list is meant to emphasize the democratic tradition in which various, committed actors work diligently and continually to enhance the ideals of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and due process that are central to democracy 1776 Declaration of Independence The succession from English authority and the development of United States of America began the great experiment of democracy. As the new nation worked to develop its identity, the legal foundations of the country were formed under the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Prior to this declaration, the notion of bail was based on English common and codified law. As no strong federal system of government would be developed for multiple years, each state developed their own legal principles and forms of implementation for pretrial release. Generally, however, these varied interpretations included the idea that excessive bail should not be imposed upon criminal defendants as set forth in the English Bill of Rights, which was passed in Parliament in 1689. 1787 Development of the U.S. Constitution Following the rejection of The Articles of Confederation, the U.S. Constitution was developed in order to codify the legal principles that would serve as the foundation for the system of governance in the United States. Articles I-IV of the Constitution provide the basic framework for each of the branches of government and their permitted functions and limitations. Article V, under the Supremacy Clause, states that the U.S. Constitution is the \"supreme law of the land\" and that each actor within the three branches of government is bound by the principles set forth within the document. 1789 Judiciary Reform Act of 1789 In an attempt to further regulate the imposition of bail and pretrial release, this legislation was passed in 1789 by the U.S. Congress. This act, along with the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights, served as the foundation for the criminal procedure for pretrial release and detention. Essentially, this act stated that all defendants, except those charged with an offense punishable by death, were able to be released pending trial. The legislation further indicated that it was the Judiciary's responsibility to exercise discretion in admitting defendants to bond or detaining them prior to trial. 1791 Bill of Rights The first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution serve to explicitly state the rights of U.S. citizens and to protect a variety of individual liberties. To many of the states, the inclusion of these amendments was so important that the ratification of the U.S. Constitution was delayed. Specifically pertaining to bail, the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments address factors related to pretrial release and detention. The Fifth Amendment sets forth minimal criminal procedure and that accused persons \"shall not be deprived of life, liberty, or property\" without due process. The Sixth Amendment requires that defendants be advised of the offense charged, be afforded assistance of counsel, be afforded a right to a speedy trial, and be afforded the opportunity to confront witnesses. Additionally, legal tradition suggests that these two Amendments provide the foundation for the presumption of innocence. The Eighth Amendment, in part, requires that excessive bail not be set. These amendments, especially the Eighth, created a long-standing legal debate of whether or not a right to bail exists within the U.S. for accused defendants. 1868 The Fourteenth Amendment Often combined with the Thirteenth Amendment under the title \"the Reconstruction Amendments,\" this alteration of the U.S. Constitution occurred following the Civil War and extended due process to all people in the United States. This extension provided for the protection of all people within a judicial district, including non-citizens. Additionally, this Amendment provided similar protections as the Fifth Amendment, but extended these rights beyond the federal government to the state level. With regard to bail, this Amendment required that all people charged with a crime be afforded the opportunity for pretrial release. 1895 Coffin v. U.S. , 156 U.S. 432 (1895) This U.S. Supreme Court case clearly defines the principle of the presumption of innocence for the first time in U.S. history. Although believed to be inferred from the U.S. Constitution, no direct recognition of this presumption had been previously articulated. The significance of this case is that it places the burden of \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" on the prosecution in criminal proceedings. In reference to setting bail, all defendants are to be presumed innocent prior to adjudication, and thus, not subject to criminal penalties prior to trial. 1951 Stack v. Boyle , 342 U.S. 1 (1951) In this case, argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, the notion of excessive bail, as set forth by the Eighth Amendment, was clarified. This case involved numerous defendants that initially had bail set at varying amounts. Upon the government's motion, bail was modified to $50,000.00 for each defendant, regardless of his risk of nonappearance before the Court. This motion was made pursuant to the government's evidence that four defendants charged with similar crimes, but completely unrelated to the present case, had previously forfeited bonds in another district. The Supreme Court clarified that the legal reasoning behind such a decision would be faulty and that defendants must be adjudged based on individual status and relative to the individual risks of nonappearance that they each pose. 1961 Establishment of The Vera Institute of Justice and the Manhattan Bail Project During this time period, the field of criminal justice saw an emergence of academic research that highlighted numerous problematic issues. The development of the Vera Institute of Justice in 1961 was one response to these issues. This independent organization, including scholars and criminal justice practitioners, sought first to evaluate the effectiveness of the imposition of bail on criminal defendants in New York City. The findings from this study suggest that numerous criminal defendants who lacked the financial ability to afford bail, but maintained significant ties to the community posed little risk of nonappearance. Thus, the unnecessary pretrial incarceration of numerous defendants was a mismanagement of public funding. Credited as the first pretrial services screening agency, The Manhattan Bail Project was developed in response to these findings and assisted judicial officers with the screening of pretrial defendants in order to minimize unnecessary detention of pretrial defendants. This study characterizes one of the first evidence-based approaches to correcting problematic bail issues. 1964 National Conference on Bail In response to public outcry to the potential incarceration of the innocent and the findings of the Vera Institute and other scholars, Attorney General Robert Kennedy convened the first National Conference on Bail in 1964. This group was charged with the comprehensive exploration of the problems facing criminal bail and potential courses of action that would resolve those problems. With assistance from numerous scholars, this comprehensive evaluation confirmed the findings of the Vera Institute nationwide. Moreover, the findings showed that the state of bail infringed upon many personal and civil liberties. The suggested solution was a systemic reform of the bail system 1966 Federal Bail Reform Act The findings of the National Conference on Bail and the Vera Institute required the U.S. Congress to take action in order to correct the shortcomings of the flawed bail system. This action came in the form of the Federal Bail Reform Act of 1966. This legislation required that all federal defendants not charged with a capital offense be released on their own recognizance prior to trial. If the judicial officer determined that this form of release would not adequately assure the presence of the defendant as required, this act permitted the judicial officer to impose the \"least restrictive\" conditions (e.g., restrictions on travel, execution of an appearance bond) necessary to ensure the defendant's presence as required. The significance of this reform is that it created a mandate for release on the least restrictive means to ensure the defendant's appearance in light of the presumption of innocence. As such, this systemic reform assisted to alleviate public concern regarding the potential incarceration of the innocent. 1967 Washington, D.C. Bail Agency Act 1974 Federal Speedy Trial Act, Including Creation of 10 Pilot Pretrial Services Agencies In the spirit of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and in response to numerous delays in court proceedings, Congress passed the Speedy Trial Act. This legislation regulated the amount of time that each step of a federal criminal proceeding may take. Specific time frames were established that dictate the amount of time that is legally permitted to pass prior to advancement to the next adjudicative stage. Additionally, this act permits specified delays in criminal proceedings in order to better serve the ends of justice and/or protect the rights of the accused. Additionally, this act permitted the creation of ten \"demonstration\" pretrial services agencies in order to prevent crime by defendants released on bond and to lower rates of nonappearance. These agencies were responsible for pretrial services investigations and supervision and served as experimental entities charged with enhancing the rate of defendants' appearance as required and protecting the safety of the community. This legislation continues to be a component of federal law and can be found at 18 U.S.C. 3161-3180. 1975 Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County , 406 F. Supp. 649 (SD Tex. 1975) This class-action case from the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas was filed by a confined prisoner, Lawrence Alberti, on behalf of all prisoners confined to the Harris County Jail. This jail had become significantly overcrowded (operating at more than 200 percent capacity) with inmates who were detained pending trial and those who were awaiting transfer to another facility. The Court held that due to the substantial number of inmates confined to the limited space, inmates were suffering cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The implications of this decision required intervention into the pretrial release system to better evaluate the appropriateness of release of numerous defendants as well as a mandate that the local county be responsible for the adequate accommodations of confined prisoners. 1978 National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies Issues Standards for Release, Detention, Danger, and Diversion Funded through a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice, and in conjunction with the Pretrial Services Resource Center, the National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies (NAPSA) was charged with the development and implementation of field standards for pretrial services agencies. This was the first development of nationwide, professional standards for these agencies. Their evidence-based approach provided an initial reference point for later evaluation and data analysis to further display the efficacy of pretrial services agencies. 1979 Bell v. Wolfish , 441 U.S. 520 (1979) This case focuses on the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable search and seizures as it pertains to detained pretrial defendants. Specifically, the Court was asked to resolve the question of whether or not it was permissible to conduct \"pat-down,\" \"strip,\" \"body-cavity searches,\" and similarly invasive seachers on detained pretrial defendants in order to better ensure the safety of the jail environment. Although the District Court upheld the prisoners' protection from these types of searches, the Supreme Court overturned this decision by a five-to-four vote. Thus, the Court held in this matter that, while incarcerated, the rights of pretrial detainees were equivalent to those of convicted offenders. 1982 The Federal Pretrial Services Act of 1982 The Federal Pretrial Services Act permitted the national expansion of the ten \"demonstration\" pretrial services agencies authorized under the Speedy Trial Act to every judicial district. Each district was permitted eighteen months in order to evaluate its needs and determine if a separate pretrial services office would best serve the court of if pretrial services functions could be managed through the U.S. Probation Office for that district. Thus, a formalized system of defendant investigation and supervision was instituted nationwide in order to provide enhanced service to the judiciary and facilitate the administration of justice. This legislation, codified at 18 U.S.C. 3152-3156, continues to serve as the foundation for the federal pretrial services system. 1984 The Federal Bail Reform Act In response to an increase in the national crime rate, declining public support for rehabilitative measures as part of the justice system, the initiation of the War on Drugs, and a general political and social move toward \"getting tough\" on crime, Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Bill. A major aspect of this legislation was the Bail Reform Act. The significant change that this act permitted was the detention of pretrial defendants on the grounds of their danger to the community. Prior to the enactment of this bill, defendants could only be detained based upon the risk of nonappearance they posed. This act also contributed to the legal question that arose following the ratification of the Bill of Rights that a defendant did not maintain an inherent right to pretrial release if they posed a significant risk of flight prior to trial and/or a danger to the safety of the community. This legislation remains the fundamental bail law in the United States and can be located at 18 U.S.C. 3141-3151. 1984 Schall v. Martin , 467 U.S. 253 (1984) This case from the U.S. Supreme Court permitted the pretrial detention of a juvenile in New York based upon his danger to the community and his risk of flight. Although the defendant in this case claimed that his Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated, the Court, in a six-to-three decision, held that such a detention was not in violation of constitutional law. In relation to the federal bail system, this case illustrates that juveniles may be detained prior to trial if the Court find sufficient cause. 1987 U.S. v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 (1987) In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Bail Reform Act of 1984 and reversed the decision of the Appellate Court. This case consisted of a alleged member of an organized crime \"mafia family\" charged under the Racketeering and Corrupt Influence Organization (RICO) statute who was believed to pose a threat to governmental witnesses if released on bond. The challenge was based on the provisions of the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The Court held that sufficient evidence was present to detain the subject prior to trial and that a \"compelling interest\" (i.e., public safety) aside from the risk of nonappearance was presented to warrant the defendant's detention. However, the Court cautioned the judiciary and pretrial services agencies by noting that the United States' system of justice is based on the presumption of innocence and that pretrial release should be \"the norm\" in the vast majority of criminal cases. 1987 Judge Tjoflat Testifies on Pretrial Services The Honorable Gerald Bard Tjoflat, U.S. circuit judge for the Eleventh Circuit and chairman of the Probation Committee, testified before the House Subcommittee on Crime (Committee on the Judiciary) on June 18, 1987. The testimony centered on implementation of the Pretrial Services Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-267), and included both the history and current status of implementation. Judge Tjoflat informed Congressman Hughes that the pretrial services function was presently 31.7 percent understaffed based on work measurement criteria. Chief of Probation Donald L. Chamlee, Chief of Operations Guy Willetts, and Chief of Program Services Harold B. Wooten responded to questions by the committee. Pretrial Specialists Daniel B. Ryan and John M. Hughes, and Pretrial Research Analyst Kevin J. Jackson (Statistical Analysis and Reports Division) also attended the hearing after working for many hours to prepare their testimony. Other staff of the Probation Division were also in attendance. 1987 First Pretrial Sevices Work Group Meets The Program Services Branch of the Probation Division conducted a work group on June 1-5, 1987, in Washington, D.C. Tasks of the group included study of the pretrial services case file revision and development of writing standards for pretrial services reports. U.S. Pretrial Services Officers Phillip M. Davis (California Eastern/Sacramento), Carolyn M. Harris (Florida Southern/Miami), Paul J. Yuhasz (New York Southern/New York City), and U.S. Probation Officer Joseph A. Kehoe (Massachusetts/ Boston) were part of the group. 1988 The National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies Revises Standards Upon evaluation of the pretrial services system since the implementation of professional standards in 1978, NAPSA examines the effectiveness of those standards in increasing the number of defendants released prior to trial. Additionally, the levels of nonappearance and community safety were gauged to determine the impact of the pretrial services system. This evidence-based approach epitomizes the accountability and individualized case management that the federal Judiciary strives to achieve. 2001 Anti-Terrorism Act In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Congress acted swiftly to criminalize and harshly penalize terrorist attacks. In this legislation, the presumption of detention established by the Bail Reform Act of 1984 and upheld in U.S. v. Salerno is extended to crimes involving terrorist activity. Thus, the likelihood that additional defendants will be detained prior to trial was increased. 2002 The American Bar Association Revises Standards Pertaining to Pretrial Release The development and espousing of pretrial release standards by the American Bar Association (ABA) represented the professional expectations of attorneys and the roles that prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judicial officers are expected to fulfill. These standards reiterate the position of the U.S. Supreme Court that defendants are to be released on the least restrictive terms possible to ensure the defendant's appearance and the safety of the community. Additionally, these standard highlight the importance of the investigation and supervision by pretrial services agencies. 2002 The U.S.A. Patriot Act In accordance with an increased public interest in terrorist activity and protecting the safety of American citizens, the U.S. Congress enacted the U.S.A. Patriot Act. This act, like the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, increases the scope of the preventive detention clause present in the Bail Reform Act of 1984. As such, the likelihood that additional defendants will be detained prior to trial is increased. 2004 The National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies Revises Standards Incorporating many of the significant developments stemming from the \"what works\" literature, a third edition of the NAPSA standards was issued. As in the past, this organization continued to exemplify the use of data and evidence-based approaches to addressing issues present in the pretrial services system. 2006 The Adam Walsh Child Protection Safety Act Due to an increase in the prevalence of sexually-based offenses involving the exploitation of children, Congress enacted the Adam Walsh Child Protection Safety Act as an amendment to the Bail Reform Act of 1984. This legislation requires that defendants charged with specific crimes are subject to numerous mandatory conditions of release if admitted to bond. As such, Congress has removed judicial discretion in these types of cases and has placed specific mandates on pretrial services offices. Return to top",

Bethel School District #43 v. Fraser (1987) Holding: Students do not have a First Amendment right to make obscene speeches in school. Matthew N. Fraser, a student at Bethel High School, was suspended for three days for delivering an obscene and provocative speech to the student body. In this speech, he nominated his fellow classmate for an elected school office. The Supreme Court held that his free speech rights were not violated. *This case relates to students. Board of Education of Independent School District #92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls (2002) Holding: Random drug tests of students involved in extracurricular activities do not violate the Fourth Amendment. In Veronia School District v. Acton (1995), the Supreme Court held that random drug tests of student athletes do not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. Some schools then began to require drug tests of all students in extracurricular activities. The Supreme Court in Earls upheld this practice. *This case relates to students. Brown v. Board of Education (1954) Holding: Separate schools are not equal. In Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the Supreme Court sanctioned segregation by upholding the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People disagreed with this ruling, challenging the constitutionality of segregation in the Topeka, Kansas, school system. In 1954, the Court reversed its Plessy decision, declaring that \"separate schools are inherently unequal.\" Learn more about this case. Honor the important figures involved in the related cases Brown v. Board of Education and Mendez v. Westminster using a readers theater presentation. Cooper v. Aaron (1958) Holding: States cannot nullify decisions of the federal courts. Several government officials in southern states, including the governor and legislature of Alabama, refused to follow the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision. They argued that the states could nullify federal court decisions if they felt that the federal courts were violating the Constitution. The Court unanimously rejected this argument and held that only the federal courts can decide when the Constitution is violated. Engel v. Vitale (1962) Holding : School initiated-prayer in the public school system violates the First Amendment. In the New York school system, each day began with a nondenominational prayer acknowledging dependence upon God. This action was challenged in Court as an unconstitutional state establishment of religion in violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court agreed, stating that the government could not sponsor such religious activities. *This case relates to students. Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) Holding: Indigent defendants must be provided representation without charge. Gideon was accused of committing a felony. Being indigent, he petitioned the judge to provide him with an attorney free of charge. The judge denied his request. The Supreme Court ruled for Gideon, saying that the Sixth Amendment requires indigent criminal defendants to be provided an attorney free of charge. Learn more about this case. Goss v. Lopez (1975) Holding: Students are entitled to certain due process rights. Nine students at an Ohio public school received 10-day suspensions for disruptive behavior without due process protections. The Supreme Court ruled for the students, saying that once the state provides an education for all of its citizens, it cannot deprive them of it without ensuring due process protections. *This case relates to students. Grutter v. Bollinger (2003) Holding: Colleges and universities have a legitimate interest in promoting diversity. Barbara Grutter alleged that her Equal Protection rights were violated when the University of Michigan Law School's attempt to gain a diverse student body resulted in the denial of her admission's application. The Supreme Court disagreed and held that institutions of higher education have a legitimate interest in promoting diversity. *This case relates to students. Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier (1988) Holding: Administrators may edit the content of school newspapers. The principal of Hazelwood East High School edited two articles in the school paper The Spectrum that he deemed inappropriate. The student authors argued that this violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that administrators can edit materials that reflect school values. *This case relates to students. Learn more about this case. Mapp v. Ohio (1961) Holding: Illegally obtained material cannot be used in a criminal trial. While searching Dollree Mapp's house, police officers discovered obscene materials and arrested her. Because the police officers never produced a search warrant, she argued that the materials should be suppressed as the fruits of an illegal search and seizure. The Supreme Court agreed and applied to the states the exclusionary rule from Weeks v. United States(1914). Learn more about this case. Marbury v. Madison (1803) Holding: Established the doctrine of judicial review. In the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress gave the Supreme Court the authority to issue certain judicial writs. The Constitution did not give the Court this power. Because the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land, the Court held that any contradictory congressional Act is without force. The ability of federal courts to declare legislative and executive actions unconstitutional is known as judicial review. Teach students the significance of Marbury v. Madison which establishes the concept of judicial review. McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) Holding: The Constitution gives the federal government certain implied powers. Maryland imposed a tax on the Bank of the United States and questioned the federal government's ability to grant charters without explicit constitutional sanction. The Supreme Court held that the tax unconstitutionally interfered with federal supremacy and ruled that the Constitution gives the federal government certain implied powers. Miranda v. Arizona (1966) Holding: Police must inform suspects of their rights before questioning. After hours of police interrogations, Ernesto Miranda confessed to rape and kidnapping. At trial, he sought to suppress his confession, stating that he was not advised of his rights to counsel and to remain silent. The Supreme Court agreed, holding that police must inform suspects of their rights before questioning. Learn more about this case. New Jersey v. T.L.O. (1985) Holding : Students have a reduced expectation of privacy in school. A teacher accused T.L.O. of smoking in the bathroom. When she denied the allegation, the principal searched her purse and found cigarettes and marijuana paraphernalia. A family court declared T.L.O. a delinquent. The Supreme Court ruled that her rights were not violated since students have reduced expectations of privacy in school. *This case relates to students. Learn more about this case. New York Times v. Sullivan (1964) Holding : In order to prove libel, a public official must show that what was said against them was made with actual malice.

The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of the newspaper saying the right to publish all statements is protected under the First Amendment. Learn more about this case. Roper v. Simmons (2005) Holding : It is cruel and unusual punishment to execute persons for crimes they committed before age 18. Matthew Simmons was sentenced to death for the murder of a woman when he was 17 years of age. In the 1988 caseThompson v. Oklahoma, the Supreme Court ruled that executing persons for crimes committed at age 15 or younger constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Roper argued that \"evolving standards of decency\" prevented the execution of an individual for crimes committed before the age of 18. A majority of the Supreme Court agreed with Roper, and held that to execute him for his crime would violate the Eighth Amendment. *This case relates to students. Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe (2000) Holding: Students may not use a school's loudspeaker system to offer student-led, student-initiated prayer. Before football games, members of the student body of a Texas high school elected one of their classmates to address the players and spectators. These addresses were conducted over the school's loudspeakers and usually involved a prayer. Attendance at these events was voluntary. Three students sued the school arguing that the prayers violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. A majority of the Court rejected the school's argument that since the prayer was student initiated and student led, as opposed to officially sponsored by the school, it did not violate the First Amendment. The Court held that this action did constitute school-sponsored prayer because the loudspeakers that the students used for their invocations were owned by the school. *This case relates to students. Terry v. Ohio (1968) Holding: Stop and frisks do not violate the Constitution under certain circumstances. Observing Terry and others acting suspiciously in front of a store, a police officer concluded that they might rob it. The officer stopped and frisked the men. A weapon was found on Terry and he was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon. The Supreme Court ruled that this search was reasonable. Texas v. Johnson (1989) Holding: Even offensive speech such as flag burning is protected by the First Amendment. To protest the policies of the Reagan administration, Gregory Lee Johnson burned an American flag outside of the Dallas City Hall. He was arrested for this act, but argued that it was symbolic speech. The Supreme Court agreed, ruling that symbolic speech is constitutionally protected even when it is offensive.

To protest the Vietnam War, Mary Beth Tinker and her brother wore black armbands to school. Fearing a disruption, the administration prohibited wearing such armbands. The Tinkers were removed from school when they failed to comply, but the Supreme Court ruled that their actions were protected by the First Amendment. *This case relates to students.

The special prosecutor in the Watergate affair subpoenaed audio tapes of Oval Office conversations. President Nixon refused to turn over the tapes, asserting executive privilege. The Supreme Court ruled that the defendants' right to potentially exculpating evidence outweighed the President's right to executive privilege if national security was not compromised. Zelma v. Simmons-Harris (2002) Holding: Certain school voucher programs are constitutional. The Ohio Pilot Scholarship Program allowed certain Ohio families to receive tuition aid from the state. This would help offset the cost of tuition at private, including parochial (religiously affiliated), schools. The Supreme Court rejected First Amendment challenges to the program and stated that such aid does not violate the Establishment Clause. *This case relates to students.

              "content": "Pretrial Services Pretrial services officers serve as the front door to the criminal justice process in the federal Judiciary. Located in each U.S. district court, pretrial services officers work with people who are charged with federal crimes and awaiting trial, helping to ensure defendants return to court for scheduled appearances and do not pose a danger to the community. Investigation When someone is charged with a crime in the federal system, a judge must determine whether that person will be released or detained pending trial . The decision is a critical moment in the criminal justice process. Judges must balance a person’s presumed innocence and right to freedom under our constitutional system with the imperative of protecting others. To aid a judge’s decision, the pretrial services officer conducts an investigation to gather and verify information about the defendant’s residence, family ties, employment history, criminal history if one exists, financial resources, and health, including any mental health or substance use issues. In addition, the officer may work with the defense attorney and assistant U.S. attorney in the case to create a suitable release plan. At this early phase, a defendant is presumed innocent. The pretrial services officer does not discuss the alleged crime or the defendant’s guilt or innocence and does not give legal advice or recommend an attorney. A pretrial services officer is often the first person a defendant meets in federal court on what is often the worst day of their lives: They’ve just been arrested and charged with a crime. Officers from around the country talk about their mission. Pretrial Risk Assessment The Pretrial Risk Assessment (PTRA) is an actuarial data tool that measures a defendant’s risk of missed court appearances, or rearrest for another crime, or the likelihood of violating court-imposed conditions of release. Incorporating data from hundreds of thousands of past cases, the PTRA tool uses algorithms to predict risk, based on factors such as criminal history, education and employment, residential ownership, citizenship status, and substance use history. Using the PTRA in combination with their professional judgement, pretrial services officers make informed recommendations to judges about release or detention and supervision strategies. Report for the Judge Information gathered in the investigation is summarized by the pretrial services officer in a report that the judge relies on to make an informed release decision. The pretrial report addresses the defendant’s likelihood of success if released to the community and includes the officer’s recommendation for release or detention pending trial. If the recommendation is to release, the officer may recommend that the court impose certain conditions tailored to the individual. For example, the officer might recommend that a defendant participate in drug testing and treatment, secure employment, or be placed on location monitoring . Conditions may prohibit the possession of guns or other weapons, contact with victims or witnesses, or association with certain people. The court may impose a curfew or conditions to restrict travel. The Bail Reform Act of 1984 requires courts to consider the least restrictive conditions needed to ensure a defendant’s appearance in court and the safety of the community. Supervision Pending trial, an individual might be released on their own recognizance. If the court orders a defendant to be supervised pending trial, pretrial services officers perform that function to help ensure compliance with the conditions set by the court. They maintain contact with defendants through various methods, including phone calls, videoconferences, and face-to-face meetings, and in various locations, such as the pretrial services office or the defendant’s home or workplace. Throughout the course of supervision, officers may also communicate with family members, employers, or treatment providers. As a condition of release, defendants may be referred to additional services, such as mental health or substance use disorder treatment programs. Pretrial services officers are involved at every critical step in the court’s decision-making before a trial begins. They play a vital role in upholding liberty, preserving public safety, and ensuring the fair administration of justice. Return to top",

Article III Judges Article III of the Constitution governs the appointment, tenure, and payment of Supreme Court justices, and federal circuit and district judges. These judges, often referred to as “Article III judges,” are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Article III states that these judges “hold their office during good behavior,” which means they have a lifetime appointment, except under very limited circumstances. Article III judges can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. Article III judgeships are created by legislation enacted by Congress. Track authorized judgeships from 1789 to present. Track judicial vacancies for Article III judges. The Constitution also provides that judges’ salaries cannot be reduced while they are in office. Article III judicial salaries are not affected by geography or length of tenure. Supreme Court Justices The nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is set out in Article III of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over certain types of cases and controversies, such as disputes between the states. The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over other matters as conferred upon the Supreme Court by various statutes, under the authority given Congress by the Constitution. Learn more about Supreme Court justices . Court of Appeals Judges Court of appeals judges, also known as circuit judges, sit in one of the 12 regional circuits across the United States, or the Federal Circuit. They usually sit in a panel of three judges and determine whether the law was applied correctly in the district court, also known as trial court, as well as appeals from decisions of federal administrative agencies and some original proceedings filed directly with the courts of appeals. Learn more about the court of appeals from the following resources: Appellate Cases District Judges District judges serve in 91 U.S. district courts across the country. They handle civil and criminal cases. A district court judge typically is responsible for supervising the pretrial process and conducting trials, which includes a variety of procedures including: managing the selection of juries and the instructions jurors receive throughout a trial; ruling on admission of evidence; pleas in criminal cases; resolving any issues surrounding the acceptance of the verdict and entry of judgment; and sentencing the defendant if a trial results in conviction. Learn more about district courts from the following resources: Civil Cases Criminal Cases Federal Judicial Center U.S. District Court History and Information Learn more about appellate and district judgeships , which are created by legislation enacted by Congress. Senior Judges Article III judges who have met age and service requirements set by federal statute are eligible to take senior status if they are at least 65 years old and have served at least 15 years on the bench, or any combination of age and years of service thereafter that equals 80. Regardless of age, judges must serve at least 10 years to qualify for senior status. Upon taking senior status, judges may choose to handle a reduced caseload. Senior judges handle about 20 percent of the total district and appellate caseload. By taking senior status, even if maintaining a full caseload, a judge creates a vacancy on the court, to be filled by the nomination and confirmation process for Article III judges. Senior judges receive the salary of their position at the time of taking senior status as an annuity. Because there is no mandatory retirement age for Article III judges, there is no requirement that they take senior status. Court of International Trade Judges The nine judges of the Court of International Trade are Article III judges appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The court is located in New York City and exercises jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1581-1585 over tariff cases, Trade Act cases, Trade Agreements Act cases, and customs matters. Other Types of Judges Other types of judges and judicial officers preside over certain kinds of cases, matters, and proceedings. Magistrate Judges Magistrate judges are judicial officers of the U.S. district courts appointed by the district judges of the court to handle a variety of judicial proceedings. Magistrate judges perform functions delegated by the district court. In criminal cases, they have authority to issue warrants, conduct preliminary proceedings, such as initial appearances and arraignments, try cases involving petty offenses committed on federal lands, and try other misdemeanor cases with the consent of the defendant. In most districts, magistrate judges handle pretrial motions and hearings in civil and criminal cases. While most civil cases are tried by district judges, magistrate judges may also preside over civil trials if all parties consent. Like other federal judges, all full-time magistrate judges are paid the same salary, regardless of where they serve or their years of service. The position and authority of magistrate judges was established in 1968. By federal law, magistrate judges must meet specified eligibility criteria, including at least five years as a member in good standing of a state or territory’s highest court bar. They must also be vetted by a merit selection panel that consists of lawyers and non-lawyers from the community. By majority vote of the U.S. district judges of the court, magistrate judges are appointed for a renewable term of eight years. In addition, there are a small number of part-time magistrate judges who serve four-year terms. The number and location of magistrate judges is determined by the Judicial Conference of the United States . Learn more about magistrate judges from the following resources: A Guide to the Legislative History of the Federal Magistrate Judges System (PDF) Inventory of United States Magistrate Judge Duties (PDF) Federal Judicial Center Information on Magistrate Judgeships Bankruptcy Judges Bankruptcy judges are judicial officers of the district court who preside exclusively over bankruptcy proceedings and cases. Bankruptcy judges receive the same annual salary, no matter where they serve or how many years of service. They are appointed to renewable 14-year terms by a majority of the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for their circuit with assistance from the circuit judicial council. The bankruptcy judge position was established in 1978, and the appointment process is set by Judicial Conference policy, in accordance with the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. Bankruptcy judges must meet eligibility criteria, including being a member of the bar in good standing. Circuit judicial councils may appoint a merit selection panel, consisting of judges and other legal professionals, to review and recommend candidates for appointment. Bankruptcy judgeships are created pursuant to legislation enacted by Congress. Learn more about the history of bankruptcy judges from the following resources: Federal Judicial Center Information on Bankruptcy Judges Territorial Court Judges Congress has established three territorial courts—in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. The judges are appointed by the President, and confirmed by the Senate, to renewable 10-year terms of office. The territorial district judges resolve federal cases in their respective territories, and operate in a similar manner to the Article III district judges in the 50 states. Court of Federal Claims Judges The U.S. Court of Federal Claims is established by statute and is located in Washington D.C. The court’s 16 judges are appointed by the President, and confirmed by the Senate, to renewable 15-year terms of office. The judges preside over claims against the United States for monetary damages; patent infringement claims in which the United States is involved; tax cases; a variety of other statutory causes of action against the United States; Congressional reference cases; and claims arising from the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. Recalled Judges Like senior status Article III judges, bankruptcy and magistrate judges may continue to provide judicial assistance after they have retired. Generally, recalled judges exercise all the powers and duties that they had as an active judge. Circuit judicial councils determine whether there is a need for recall services from bankruptcy and magistrate judges based on the court's workload. In addition, recall requests that seek staffing or that cost more than a certain amount in additional salary and travel expenses must be approved by a Judicial Conference committee. Retired bankruptcy and magistrate judges are appointed for recall service for a specific period of time but no more than five years, which may be renewed. Visiting Judges Visiting judges may sit by designation in any federal court having a need for their service. They provide temporary assistance not only when a court’s own judges must disqualify themselves, but also to help meet the caseload needs arising from vacancies, lack of sufficient judgeships, specific emergencies, and other workload imbalances. Visiting judges sitting in another court within their circuit are on an intracircuit assignment, which is approved by the circuit chief judge. Judges sitting with a court outside of their home circuit are on an intercircuit assignment. For Article III judges, intercircuit assignments must be approved by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Temporary assignments for bankruptcy and magistrate judges are coordinated by chief judges of the courts and circuits.

              "content": "Presentence Investigations Determining an appropriate sentence is one of the most critical decisions in the criminal justice process. By law, courts must impose sentences that are “sufficient but not greater than necessary” to accomplish the goals of sentencing: punishment, deterrence, community safety, and rehabilitation. The Role of Probation Officers Probation officers have substantial responsibilities in assisting the court during the sentencing phase. The probation officer conducts an independent and impartial investigation of the defendant and the offense before making a sentencing recommendation to the judge. To conduct the investigations, officers must have strong writing, investigatory, and analytical skills. Presentence investigation officers come from a variety of educational and professional backgrounds, such as law enforcement, social work, and law. The Presentence Investigation When a defendant pleads guilty or is found guilty of a crime, prior to sentencing, a presentence investigation and report are completed to ensure the judge has as much information as possible to determine an appropriate sentence. During the presentence investigation, the officer conducts an extensive interview with the defendant to discuss the individual’s history and background, including childhood experiences, family factors, education, employment, criminal history, finances, physical and mental health, and alcohol or drug use. The officer verifies the information through contacts with family members, friends, employers, and community members. During this stage, the officer also gathers documentation that can provide useful information for the court, such as court and school records, military service and employment records, and documents related to the defendant’s finances and medical and employment history. The officer also conducts a thorough review of the criminal offense, including interviews with law enforcement officers and victims. The Presentence Report The presentence report summarizes information gathered during the presentence investigation, including the offense, prior criminal history, social history, applicable advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines , and victim impact statements. In the report, the officer provides a sentencing recommendation, which includes an analysis and justification. The process entails a careful analysis of the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the applicable statutes and advisory sentencing guidelines. The recommendation includes information about any departures from the guidelines that may be relevant to the case. Prior to sentencing, the report is reviewed for accuracy by the defendant, the defense counsel, and the prosecutor. The parties can recommend changes to the report. In response, the officer either makes the requested changes or explains why they were not made. Typically, the officer attends the sentencing hearing and may be called on by the court to answer questions or provide additional information. Before imposing a sentence, the judge considers information from the presentence report, the defense counsel, and the prosecutor and statements from the defendant and sometimes from victims. Additional Uses of Presentencing Reports The presentence report can be useful beyond the sentencing hearing. For example, the Bureau of Prisons relies on presentence reports for custody location and classification, and to determine programming needs. Following the defendant’s release from custody, probation officers rely on the presentence report to assist with reentry planning and post-conviction supervision. Return to top",

                  "content": "Types of Federal Judges Federal judges work to ensure equal justice under the law. Learn about the different kinds of federal judges and the cases they hear. Article III Judges Article III of the Constitution governs the appointment, tenure, and payment of Supreme Court justices, and federal circuit and district judges. These judges, often referred to as “Article III judges,” are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Article III states that these judges “hold their office during good behavior,” which means they have a lifetime appointment, except under very limited circumstances. Article III judges can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. Article III judgeships are created by legislation enacted by Congress. Track authorized judgeships from 1789 to present. Track judicial vacancies for Article III judges. The Constitution also provides that judges’ salaries cannot be reduced while they are in office. Article III judicial salaries are not affected by geography or length of tenure. Supreme Court Justices The nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is set out in Article III of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over certain types of cases and controversies, such as disputes between the states. The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over other matters as conferred upon the Supreme Court by various statutes, under the authority given Congress by the Constitution. Learn more about Supreme Court justices . Court of Appeals Judges Court of appeals judges, also known as circuit judges, sit in one of the 12 regional circuits across the United States, or the Federal Circuit. They usually sit in a panel of three judges and determine whether the law was applied correctly in the district court, also known as trial court, as well as appeals from decisions of federal administrative agencies and some original proceedings filed directly with the courts of appeals. Learn more about the court of appeals from the following resources: Appellate Cases District Judges District judges serve in 91 U.S. district courts across the country. They handle civil and criminal cases. A district court judge typically is responsible for supervising the pretrial process and conducting trials, which includes a variety of procedures including: managing the selection of juries and the instructions jurors receive throughout a trial; ruling on admission of evidence; pleas in criminal cases; resolving any issues surrounding the acceptance of the verdict and entry of judgment; and sentencing the defendant if a trial results in conviction. Learn more about district courts from the following resources: Civil Cases Criminal Cases Federal Judicial Center U.S. District Court History and Information Learn more about appellate and district judgeships , which are created by legislation enacted by Congress. Senior Judges Article III judges who have met age and service requirements set by federal statute are eligible to take senior status if they are at least 65 years old and have served at least 15 years on the bench, or any combination of age and years of service thereafter that equals 80. Regardless of age, judges must serve at least 10 years to qualify for senior status. Upon taking senior status, judges may choose to handle a reduced caseload. Senior judges handle about 20 percent of the total district and appellate caseload. By taking senior status, even if maintaining a full caseload, a judge creates a vacancy on the court, to be filled by the nomination and confirmation process for Article III judges. Senior judges receive the salary of their position at the time of taking senior status as an annuity. Because there is no mandatory retirement age for Article III judges, there is no requirement that they take senior status. Court of International Trade Judges The nine judges of the Court of International Trade are Article III judges appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The court is located in New York City and exercises jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1581-1585 over tariff cases, Trade Act cases, Trade Agreements Act cases, and customs matters. Other Types of Judges Other types of judges and judicial officers preside over certain kinds of cases, matters, and proceedings. Magistrate Judges Magistrate judges are judicial officers of the U.S. district courts appointed by the district judges of the court to handle a variety of judicial proceedings. Magistrate judges perform functions delegated by the district court. In criminal cases, they have authority to issue warrants, conduct preliminary proceedings, such as initial appearances and arraignments, try cases involving petty offenses committed on federal lands, and try other misdemeanor cases with the consent of the defendant. In most districts, magistrate judges handle pretrial motions and hearings in civil and criminal cases. While most civil cases are tried by district judges, magistrate judges may also preside over civil trials if all parties consent. Like other federal judges, all full-time magistrate judges are paid the same salary, regardless of where they serve or their years of service. The position and authority of magistrate judges was established in 1968. By federal law, magistrate judges must meet specified eligibility criteria, including at least five years as a member in good standing of a state or territory’s highest court bar. They must also be vetted by a merit selection panel that consists of lawyers and non-lawyers from the community. By majority vote of the U.S. district judges of the court, magistrate judges are appointed for a renewable term of eight years. In addition, there are a small number of part-time magistrate judges who serve four-year terms. The number and location of magistrate judges is determined by the Judicial Conference of the United States . Learn more about magistrate judges from the following resources: A Guide to the Legislative History of the Federal Magistrate Judges System (PDF) Inventory of United States Magistrate Judge Duties (PDF) Federal Judicial Center Information on Magistrate Judgeships Bankruptcy Judges Bankruptcy judges are judicial officers of the district court who preside exclusively over bankruptcy proceedings and cases. Bankruptcy judges receive the same annual salary, no matter where they serve or how many years of service. They are appointed to renewable 14-year terms by a majority of the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for their circuit with assistance from the circuit judicial council. The bankruptcy judge position was established in 1978, and the appointment process is set by Judicial Conference policy, in accordance with the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. Bankruptcy judges must meet eligibility criteria, including being a member of the bar in good standing. Circuit judicial councils may appoint a merit selection panel, consisting of judges and other legal professionals, to review and recommend candidates for appointment. Bankruptcy judgeships are created pursuant to legislation enacted by Congress. Learn more about the history of bankruptcy judges from the following resources: Federal Judicial Center Information on Bankruptcy Judges Territorial Court Judges Congress has established three territorial courts—in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. The judges are appointed by the President, and confirmed by the Senate, to renewable 10-year terms of office. The territorial district judges resolve federal cases in their respective territories, and operate in a similar manner to the Article III district judges in the 50 states. Court of Federal Claims Judges The U.S. Court of Federal Claims is established by statute and is located in Washington D.C. The court’s 16 judges are appointed by the President, and confirmed by the Senate, to renewable 15-year terms of office. The judges preside over claims against the United States for monetary damages; patent infringement claims in which the United States is involved; tax cases; a variety of other statutory causes of action against the United States; Congressional reference cases; and claims arising from the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. Recalled Judges Like senior status Article III judges, bankruptcy and magistrate judges may continue to provide judicial assistance after they have retired. Generally, recalled judges exercise all the powers and duties that they had as an active judge. Circuit judicial councils determine whether there is a need for recall services from bankruptcy and magistrate judges based on the court's workload. In addition, recall requests that seek staffing or that cost more than a certain amount in additional salary and travel expenses must be approved by a Judicial Conference committee. Retired bankruptcy and magistrate judges are appointed for recall service for a specific period of time but no more than five years, which may be renewed. Visiting Judges Visiting judges may sit by designation in any federal court having a need for their service. They provide temporary assistance not only when a court’s own judges must disqualify themselves, but also to help meet the caseload needs arising from vacancies, lack of sufficient judgeships, specific emergencies, and other workload imbalances. Visiting judges sitting in another court within their circuit are on an intracircuit assignment, which is approved by the circuit chief judge. Judges sitting with a court outside of their home circuit are on an intercircuit assignment. For Article III judges, intercircuit assignments must be approved by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Temporary assignments for bankruptcy and magistrate judges are coordinated by chief judges of the courts and circuits.

              "content": "Post-Conviction Supervision Following a conviction, probation officers work to protect the community and to assist individuals with making long-term positive changes in their lives, relying on proactive interventions and evidence-based practices. Probation officers describe their work protecting community safety while helping individuals restart their lives after prison. In this video, they say they are “change agents” who try to guide former offenders to better decision-making and, ultimately, to better lives. Goals The goal of supervision is the successful completion of the term of supervision, which means that the person under supervision commits no new crimes, meets court-imposed responsibilities, and prepares for continued success by developing new skills and self-management abilities. Types of Supervision Some people convicted of federal crimes are ordered released to the community on a term of probation . Probation serves as an alternative to incarceration while holding people accountable for their actions. Individuals convicted of more serious crimes may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, followed by a period of supervised release in the community. (People convicted of military offenses or convicted in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia may also serve a term of federal supervision.) Supervision Conditions Individuals assigned to community supervision are expected to abide by certain conditions imposed by the court. Some conditions are universally imposed, such as prohibitions on committing new crimes or possessing or using illicit drugs. Other conditions are discretionary on the part of the judge and dependent on an individual’s circumstances. They could include restrictions on associations with others or participation in a substance use disorder or mental health program.

They hold in-person meetings in their ... Probation officers maintain regular contact with people under supervision. They hold in-person meetings in their offices and at other locations, such as homes or job sites. Post-Conviction Risk Assessment Individualized risk and needs assessments are conducted throughout the term of supervision. Assessments help determine the intensity of supervision and help officers identify aspects of an individual’s life that contribute to criminality. For example, a person’s social influences, substance use behaviors, patterns of thinking, or ability to meet basic needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter, can all contribute to involvement in the criminal justice system. Supervision Planning Effective supervision requires an individualized approach. To achieve this, officers employ evidence-based practices , defined as the conscientious use of the best evidence currently available to inform decisions. Probation officers work with individuals to develop comprehensive plans that address a person’s unique risks and needs, establish short- and long-term goals, and promote compliance with court-ordered conditions. The probation officer maintains regular contact with the person under supervision via telephone, videoconferencing, and face-to-face meetings in an office or community setting to determine if changes to the supervision plan are needed. Supervision Strategies Officers rely on risk assessments and evidence-based practices to inform the selection and implementation of supervision strategies. Strategies include monitoring activities, restrictions, and interventions: Monitoring activities, such as regular check-ins with a probation officer, serve the dual purpose of encouraging compliance and keeping the officer aware of an individual’s activities. Restrictions, such as curfews or abstinence from drugs and alcohol, are used to limit high risk activities or associations with others. Interventions and skill-building are critical components of supervision and include strategies to help individuals understand the connection between thoughts and behaviors, develop problem-solving skills, and get treatment for substance use and other factors linked to involvement in the criminal justice system. Probation officers prioritize the development of a strong working alliance with people under supervision to support the interventions and promote lawful behavior. Officers also collaborate with family members, friends, employers, and treatment providers who impact an individual’s daily life. Such contacts can help form critical partners in the supervision process and allow officers to identify issues that contribute to criminal activity, such as substance use, association with criminally involved peers, or unstable employment. Research has demonstrated that using a combination of strategies is more effective than using one strategy alone. The objective of all the supervision strategies is to help people achieve positive and lasting behavioral change in their lives.

Legal Skills as Life Skills Rule of Law in Your Life The rule of law is the foundation of an orderly society. It creates a quality of life in which rights and responsibilities are respected. This 50-minute activity includes a video and live conversation with a judge about how the rule of law has a positive impact on everyday life. Court Shorts: Rule of Law This four minute video and these Discussion-Starter Questions (doc) set the stage for engaging students, teachers, and adult learners with the Supreme Court Cases listed below. The video and dialogue can be part of a distance-learning experience (doc) with a federal judge. Find Supreme Court Cases for classroom exploration . Rule of Law and the First Amendment in Action Expression of Unpopular Opinions Free Exercise of Religion Rule of Law and Civic Engagement in Action Participation in the Judicial Process Access to Education The Right to Vote Separation of Powers in Your Life The dynamics of the separation of powers shape the role of government in daily life. As part of a 50-minute distance-learning experience with a federal judge, a brief video and an exploratory conversation make this abstract concept real for students. Court Shorts: Separation of Powers This four-minute video brings the separation of powers into the lives of students, teachers, and adult learners using the landmark case Texas v. Johnson in which a young protester burns the American flag. The Discussion-Starter Questions (doc) support the video. Separation of Powers and the 1st Amendment Students are attuned to the veracity of public statements. When a politician is accused of lying about his military record, all three branches come into play. In this case, the Judicial Branch decides if the First Amendment protects falsehoods. U.S. v. Alvarez: Are Lies Protected Speech? Separation of Powers and the 14th Amendment The dynamics of the separation of powers were instrumental in the evolution of Title IX. The interplay of the three branches changed the future of student athletics. The federal court decision that came out of that struggle had a lasting impact. The Evolution of Title IX: And Gender Equity in Sports Judicial Independence in Your Life Judicial independence and judicial impartiality go hand in hand. Judicial independence assures litigants that judges will be impartial. These activities give insight into what judicial independence means to judges and, more importantly, what it means to litigants and society at large. Judicial Independence in Perspective The video and discussion questions are a backdrop for the resources here. The materials deal with the establishment of the federal court system; the landmark case that carved out the Judiciary’s equal status among the branches; and the role of the Courts of Appeals. The Federal Courts and You Marbury v. Madison: Still Relevant After All These Years The Role of the Court of Appeals in an Impartial Judiciary Judicial Independence and Judges Federal Judges' Oath of Office The intersection of the separation of powers and judicial independence comes to light in the judicial nomination and confirmation process. Although judges are nominated by the President and are confirmed by Congress, they are independent of both branches. When judges take the oath of office they commit to being independent and impartial. The Judicial Nomination Process and the Judges’ Oath Legal Skills as Life Skills Judges bring courtroom programs into the distance-learning space with this series of activities that teach legal skills as life skills. 90-Minute Distance-Learning Module Elonis v. U.S. Applied to Civil Discourse: Social Media and Cyberbullying . In this simulation, all students serve as lawyers and then as juror to examine the legal issues when a high school DJ uses memes to convey a message to his ex-girlfriend. Is the message a threat or is it artistic expression? Students practice civil discourse and problem-solving skills. 60-Minute Distance-Learning Module Morse v. Frederick Applied to Civil Discourse:16-Year-Olds and the Right to Vote . Students in a school-supervised Constitution Day car parade demand the right to vote at age 16.

          "content": "Post Conviction Risk Assessment The federal Post Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA) is a scientifically based instrument developed by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of post-conviction supervision. The PCRA makes it possible for officers to focus their efforts on the people who are at the greatest risk of failing on supervision and committing new crimes. The United States probation and pretrial services system embraces evidence-based practices (EBP), which employ the best available scientific data to influence supervision decisions. A key element of the evidence-­based approach is the use of the PCRA to achieve maximum, measurable reductions in recidivism. Using the PCRA, officers can make informed decisions about: Which persons to target for correctional interventions. What characteristics or needs to address. How to deliver supervision and treatment in a way that produces the best outcomes. On this page, you will find links to two important documents that provide more information about the PCRA: The Overview of the Post Conviction Risk Assessment provides an easy-to-digest overview of risk assessment and the use of the PCRA in the United States probation system.

          "content": "Pretrial Risk Assessment The federal Pretrial Risk Assessment (PTRA) is a scientifically based instrument developed by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) and used by United States probation and pretrial services officers to assist in determining a defendant’s risk of failure to appear, new criminal arrests, or technical violations that may lead to revocation while in the pretrial services system. In conjunction with a thorough pretrial services investigation, the PTRA helps officers make well-informed decisions when making release or detention recommendations to the court. Officers’ investigations and recommendations represent critical components in the criminal justice process to reasonably ensure the future appearance of defendants in court, while ensuring the safety of the community. The United States probation and pretrial services system embraces evidence-based practices (EBP), which employ the best available scientific data to influence release and detention decisions. A key element of the evidence-­based approach is the use of risk assessment instruments to achieve maximum, measurable reductions in pretrial failure rates. Using the PTRA in combination with their professional judgement, officers can make informed decisions about which people are suitable for release recommendations and help inform possible supervision strategies. The PTRA gives officers an accurate, evidence-based assessment of: A person’s failing to appear. His or her revocation or new criminal activity. On this page, you will find links to important documents that provide more information about the PTRA.

Statistical algorithms can outperform human predictions of recidivism. Dressel and Farid recently found that laypeople were as accurate as statistical algorithms in predicting whether a defendant would reoffend, casting doubt on the value of risk assessment tools in the criminal justice system. We report the results of a replication and extension of Dressel and Farid’s experiment. Under conditions similar to the original study, we found nearly identical results, with humans and algorithms performing comparably. However, algorithms beat humans in the three other datasets we examined. The performance gap between humans and algorithms was particularly pronounced when, in a departure from the original study, participants were not provided with immediate feedback on the accuracy of their responses. Algorithms also outperformed humans when the information provided for predictions included an enriched (versus restricted) set of risk factors. These results suggest that algorithms can outperform human predictions of recidivism in ecologically valid settings.",

Federal courts of appeals review the procedures and the decisions in the district courts, also known as trial courts, to make sure that the proceedings were fair and that the law was applied correctly. The courts of appeals routinely handle more than 50,000 cases each year. Ten percent or fewer of those decisions are appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in turn hears oral arguments in fewer than 100 cases annually. Thus, most courts of appeals decisions are final, and they are binding on lower courts within the same circuit. What is the Structure of Courts of Appeals? In the federal system, 94 district courts are organized into 12 regional circuits. Each circuit has its own court of appeals that reviews cases decided in U.S. district courts within the circuit. Unlike trial courts, appellate courts do not retry cases or hear new evidence; they do not hear witnesses testify; and there is no jury. Download a map of the 12 regional circuits . The appellate courts also can review decisions by federal administrative agencies, as well as hear some original proceedings filed directly with the courts of appeals. In addition, a 13th court of appeals, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has nationwide jurisdiction to hear appeals in specialized cases, such as those involving patent laws, and cases decided by the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims . Learn more about the appellate process . Who Serves in Courts of Appeals? Court of appeals judges , also called circuit judges, usually sit in a panel of three judges to determine whether the law was applied correctly by a lower court or administrative agency.

There are exceptions to both requirements for certain categories of debtors, exigent circumstances, or if the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator have determined that there are insufficient approved credit counseling agencies available to provide the necessary counseling. Creditor A person to whom or business to which the debtor owes money or that claims to be owed money by the debtor. D Damages Money that a defendant pays a plaintiff in a civil case if the plaintiff has won. Damages may be compensatory (for loss or injury) or punitive (to punish and deter future misconduct). De facto Latin, meaning \"in fact\" or \"actually.\" Something that exists in fact but not as a matter of law. De jure Latin, meaning \"in law.\" Something that exists by operation of law.

Such statements are often taken to examine potential witnesses, to obtain discovery, or to be used later in trial. See discovery. Discharge A release of a debtor from personal liability for certain dischargeable debts. Notable exceptions to dischargeability are taxes and student loans. A discharge releases a debtor from personal liability for certain debts known as dischargeable debts and prevents the creditors owed those debts from taking any action against the debtor or the debtor's property to collect the debts. The discharge also prohibits creditors from communicating with the debtor regarding the debt, including through telephone calls, letters, and personal contact. Dischargeable debt A debt for which the Bankruptcy Code allows the debtor's personal liability to be eliminated. Disclosure statement A written document prepared by the chapter 11 debtor or other plan proponent that is designed to provide \"adequate information\" to creditors to enable them to evaluate the chapter 11 plan of reorganization.

Due process In criminal law, the constitutional guarantee that a defendant will receive a fair and impartial trial. In civil law, the legal rights of someone who confronts an adverse action threatening liberty or property. E En banc French, meaning \"on the bench.\" All judges of an appellate court sitting together to hear a case, as opposed to the routine disposition by panels of three judges. In the Ninth Circuit, an en banc panel consists of 11 randomly selected judges. Equitable Pertaining to civil suits in \"equity\" rather than in \"law.\" In English legal history, the courts of \"law\" could order the payment of damages and could afford no other remedy (see damages). A separate court of \"equity\" could order someone to do something or to cease to do something (e.g., injunction). In American jurisprudence, the federal courts have both legal and equitable power, but the distinction is still an important one. For example, a trial by jury is normally available in \"law\" cases but not in \"equity\" cases. Equity The value of a debtor's interest in property that remains after liens and other creditors' interests are considered. (Example: If a house valued at $60,000 is subject to a $30,000 mortgage, there is $30,000 of equity.) Evidence Information presented in testimony or in documents that is used to persuade the fact finder (judge or jury) to decide the case in favor of one side or the other. Ex parte A proceeding brought before a court by one party only, without notice to or challenge by the other side. Exclusionary rule Doctrine that says evidence obtained in violation of a criminal defendant's constitutional or statutory rights is not admissible at trial. Exculpatory evidence Evidence indicating that a defendant did not commit the crime. Executory contracts Contracts or leases under which both parties to the agreement have duties remaining to be performed. If a contract or lease is executory, a debtor may assume it (keep the contract) or reject it (terminate the contract). Exempt assets Property that a debtor is allowed to retain, free from the claims of creditors who do not have liens on the property. Exemptions, exempt property Certain property owned by an individual debtor that the Bankruptcy Code or applicable state law permits the debtor to keep from unsecured creditors. For example, in some states the debtor may be able to exempt all or a portion of the equity in the debtor's primary residence (homestead exemption), or some or all \"tools of the trade\" used by the debtor to make a living (i.e., auto tools for an auto mechanic or dental tools for a dentist). The availability and amount of property the debtor may exempt depends on the state the debtor lives in. F Face sheet filing A bankruptcy case filed either without schedules or with incomplete schedules listing few creditors and debts. (Face sheet filings are often made for the purpose of delaying an eviction or foreclosure Family farmer An individual, individual and spouse, corporation, or partnership engaged in a farming operation that meets certain debt limits and other statutory criteria for filing a petition under Chapter 12.

The judiciary administers the federal defender program pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act. Federal public defender organization As provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, an organization established within a federal judicial circuit to represent criminal defendants who cannot afford an adequate defense. Each organization is supervised by a federal public defender appointed by the court of appeals for the circuit. Federal question jurisdiction Jurisdiction given to federal courts in cases involving the interpretation and application of the U.S. Constitution, acts of Congress, and treaties. Felony A serious crime, usually punishable by at least one year in prison. File To place a paper in the official custody of the clerk of court to enter into the files or records of a case. Fraudulent transfer A transfer of a debtor's property made with intent to defraud or for which the debtor receives less than the transferred property's value. Fresh start The characterization of a debtor's status after bankruptcy, i.e., free of most debts. (Giving debtors a fresh start is one purpose of the Bankruptcy Code.) G Grand jury A body of 16-23 citizens who listen to evidence of criminal allegations, which is presented by the prosecutors, and determine whether there is probable cause to believe an individual committed an offense. See also indictment and U.S. attorney. H Habeas corpus Latin, meaning \"you have the body.\" A writ of habeas corpus generally is a judicial order forcing law enforcement authorities to produce a prisoner they are holding, and to justify the prisoner's continued confinement. Federal judges receive petitions for a writ of habeas corpus from state prison inmates who say their state prosecutions violated federally protected rights in some way. Hearsay Evidence presented by a witness who did not see or hear the incident in question but heard about it from someone else. With some exceptions, hearsay generally is not admissible as evidence at trial Home confinement A special condition the court imposes that requires an individual to remain at home except for certain approved activities such as work and medical appointments. Home confinement may include the use of electronic monitoring equipment – a transmitter attached to the wrist or the ankle – to help ensure that the person stays at home as required. I Impeachment 1. The process of calling a witness's testimony into doubt. For example, if the attorney can show that the witness may have fabricated portions of his testimony, the witness is said to be \"impeached;\" 2. The constitutional process whereby the House of Representatives may \"impeach\" (accuse of misconduct) high officers of the federal government, who are then tried by the Senate. In camera Latin, meaning in a judge's chambers. Often means outside the presence of a jury and the public. In private.

M Magistrate judge A judicial officer of a district court who conducts initial proceedings in criminal cases, decides criminal misdemeanor cases, conducts many pretrial civil and criminal matters on behalf of district judges, and decides civil cases with the consent of the parties. Means test Section 707(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code applies a \"means test\" to determine whether an individual debtor's chapter 7 filing is presumed to be an abuse of the Bankruptcy Code requiring dismissal or conversion of the case (generally to chapter 13). Abuse is presumed if the debtor's aggregate current monthly income (see definition above) over 5 years, net of certain statutorily allowed expenses is more than (i) $10,000, or (ii) 25% of the debtor's nonpriority unsecured debt, as long as that amount is at least $6,000. The debtor may rebut a presumption of abuse only by a showing of special circumstances that justify additional expenses or adjustments of current monthly income.

When a mistrial is declared, the trial must start again with the selection of a new jury. Moot Not subject to a court ruling because the controversy has not actually arisen, or has ended Motion A request by a litigant to a judge for a decision on an issue relating to the case. Motion in Limine A pretrial motion requesting the court to prohibit the other side from presenting, or even referring to, evidence on matters said to be so highly prejudicial that no steps taken by the judge can prevent the jury from being unduly influenced. Motion to lift the automatic stay A request by a creditor to allow the creditor to take action against the debtor or the debtor's property that would otherwise be prohibited by the automatic stay. N No-asset case A Chapter 7 case in which there are no assets available to satisfy any portion of the creditors' unsecured claims. Nolo contendere No contest. A plea of nolo contendere has the same effect as a plea of guilty, as far as the criminal sentence is concerned, but may not be considered as an admission of guilt for any other purpose. Nondischargeable debt A debt that cannot be eliminated in bankruptcy. Examples include a home mortgage, debts for alimony or child support, certain taxes, debts for most government funded or guaranteed educational loans or benefit overpayments, debts arising from death or personal injury caused by driving while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, and debts for restitution or a criminal fine included in a sentence on the debtor's conviction of a crime. Some debts, such as debts for money or property obtained by false pretenses and debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity may be declared nondischargeable only if a creditor timely files and prevails in a nondischargeability action. Nonexempt assets Property of a debtor that can be liquidated to satisfy claims of creditors. O Objection to dischargeability A trustee's or creditor's objection to the debtor being released from personal liability for certain dischargeable debts. Common reasons include allegations that the debt to be discharged was incurred by false pretenses or that debt arose because of the debtor's fraud while acting as a fiduciary. Objection to exemptions A trustee's or creditor's objection to the debtor's attempt to claim certain property as exempt from liquidation by the trustee to creditors. Opinion A judge's written explanation of the decision of the court. Because a case may be heard by three or more judges in the court of appeals, the opinion in appellate decisions can take several forms. If all the judges completely agree on the result, one judge will write the opinion for all. If all the judges do not agree, the formal decision will be based upon the view of the majority, and one member of the majority will write the opinion. The judges who did not agree with the majority may write separately in dissenting or concurring opinions to present their views. A dissenting opinion disagrees with the majority opinion because of the reasoning and/or the principles of law the majority used to decide the case. A concurring opinion agrees with the decision of the majority opinion, but offers further comment or clarification or even an entirely different reason for reaching the same result. Only the majority opinion can serve as binding precedent in future cases. See also precedent. Oral argument An opportunity for lawyers to summarize their position before the court and also to answer the judges' questions. P Panel 1. In appellate cases, a group of judges (usually three) assigned to decide the case; 2. In the jury selection process, the group of potential jurors; 3. The list of attorneys who are both available and qualified to serve as court-appointed counsel for criminal defendants who cannot afford their own counsel. Parole The release of a prison inmate – granted by the U.S. Parole Commission – after the inmate has completed part of his or her sentence in a federal prison. When the parolee is released to the community, he or she is placed under the supervision of a U.S. probation officer. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 abolished parole in favor of a determinate sentencing system in which the sentence is set by sentencing guidelines. Now, without the option of parole, the term of imprisonment the court imposes is the actual time the person spends in prison. Party in interest A party who has standing to be heard by the court in a matter to be decided in the bankruptcy case. The debtor, U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator, case trustee, and creditors are parties in interest for most matters. Per curiam Latin, meaning \"for the court.\" In appellate courts, often refers to an unsigned opinion. Peremptory challenge A district court may grant each side in a civil or criminal trial the right to exclude a certain number of prospective jurors without cause or giving a reason.

Petition preparer A business not authorized to practice law that prepares bankruptcy petitions. Petty offense A federal misdemeanor punishable by six months or less in prison. Plaintiff A person or business that files a formal complaint with the court. Plan A debtor's detailed description of how the debtor proposes to pay creditors' claims over a fixed period of time. Plea In a criminal case, the defendant's statement pleading \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" in answer to the charges. See also nolo contendere. Pleadings Written statements filed with the court that describe a party's legal or factual assertions about the case. Postpetition transfer A transfer of the debtor's property made after the commencement of the case. Prebankruptcy planning The arrangement (or rearrangement) of a debtor's property to allow the debtor to take maximum advantage of exemptions. (Prebankruptcy planning typically includes converting nonexempt assets into exempt assets.) Precedent A court decision in an earlier case with facts and legal issues similar to a dispute currently before a court. Judges will generally \"follow precedent\" - meaning that they use the principles established in earlier cases to decide new cases that have similar facts and raise similar legal issues. A judge will disregard precedent if a party can show that the earlier case was wrongly decided, or that it differed in some significant way from the current case. Preferential debt payment A debt payment made to a creditor in the 90-day period before a debtor files bankruptcy (or within one year if the creditor was an insider) that gives the creditor more than the creditor would receive in the debtor's chapter 7 case. Presentence report A report prepared by a court's probation officer, after a person has been convicted of an offense, summarizing for the court the background information needed to determine the appropriate sentence. Pretrial conference A meeting of the judge and lawyers to plan the trial, to discuss which matters should be presented to the jury, to review proposed evidence and witnesses, and to set a trial schedule. Typically, the judge and the parties also discuss the possibility of settlement of the case. Pretrial services A function of the federal courts that takes place at the very start of the criminal justice process – after a person has been arrested and charged with a federal crime and before he or she goes to trial. Pretrial services officers focus on investigating the backgrounds of these persons to help the court determine whether to release or detain them while they await trial. The decision is based on whether these individuals are likely to flee or pose a threat to the community. If the court orders release, a pretrial services officer supervises the person in the community until he or she returns to court. Priority The Bankruptcy Code's statutory ranking of unsecured claims that determines the order in which unsecured claims will be paid if there is not enough money to pay all unsecured claims in full. Priority claim An unsecured claim that is entitled to be paid ahead of other unsecured claims that are not entitled to priority status. Priority refers to the order in which these unsecured claims are to be paid. Pro per A slang expression sometimes used to refer to a pro se litigant. It is a corruption of the Latin phrase \"in propria persona.\" Pro se Representing oneself. Serving as one's own lawyer. Pro tem Temporary. Probation Sentencing option in the federal courts. With probation, instead of sending an individual to prison, the court releases the person to the community and orders him or her to complete a period of supervision monitored by a U.S. probation officer and to abide by certain conditions. Probation officer Officers of the probation office of a court. Probation officer duties include conducting presentence investigations, preparing presentence reports on convicted defendants, and supervising released defendants.

S Sanction A penalty or other type of enforcement used to bring about compliance with the law or with rules and regulations. Schedules Lists submitted by the debtor along with the petition (or shortly thereafter) showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, and other financial information. (There are official forms a debtor must use.) Secured creditor A secured creditor is an individual or business that holds a claim against the debtor that is secured by a lien on property of the estate. The property subject to the lien is the secured creditor's collateral. Secured debt Debt backed by a mortgage, pledge of collateral, or other lien; debt for which the creditor has the right to pursue specific pledged property upon default. Examples include home mortgages, auto loans and tax liens. Senior judge A federal judge who, after attaining the requisite age and length of judicial experience, takes senior status, thus creating a vacancy among a court's active judges. A senior judge retains the judicial office and may cut back his or her workload by as much as 75 percent, but many opt to keep a larger caseload. Sentence The punishment ordered by a court for a defendant convicted of a crime. Sentencing guidelines A set of rules and principles established by the United States Sentencing Commission that trial judges use to determine the sentence for a convicted defendant. Sequester To separate. Sometimes juries are sequestered from outside influences during their deliberations. Service of process The delivery of writs or summonses to the appropriate party. Settlement Parties to a lawsuit resolve their dispute without having a trial. Settlements often involve the payment of compensation by one party in at least partial satisfaction of the other party's claims, but usually do not include the admission of fault. Small business case A special type of chapter 11 case in which there is no creditors' committee (or the creditors' committee is deemed inactive by the court) and in which the debtor is subject to more oversight by the U.S. trustee than other chapter 11 debtors. The Bankruptcy Code contains certain provisions designed to reduce the time a small business debtor is in bankruptcy. Standard of proof Degree of proof required. In criminal cases, prosecutors must prove a defendant's guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The majority of civil lawsuits require proof \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" (50 percent plus), but in some the standard is higher and requires \"clear and convincing\" proof. Statement of financial affairs A series of questions the debtor must answer in writing concerning sources of income, transfers of property, lawsuits by creditors, etc. (There is an official form a debtor must use.) Statement of intention A declaration made by a chapter 7 debtor concerning plans for dealing with consumer debts that are secured by property of the estate. Statute A law passed by a legislature. Statute of limitations The time within which a lawsuit must be filed or a criminal prosecution begun. The deadline can vary, depending on the type of civil case or the crime charged. Sua sponte Latin, meaning \"of its own will.\" Often refers to a court taking an action in a case without being asked to do so by either side. Subordination The act or process by which a person's rights or claims are ranked below those of others. Subpoena A command, issued under a court's authority, to a witness to appear and give testimony. Subpoena duces tecum A command to a witness to appear and produce documents.

Trustee The representative of the bankruptcy estate who exercises statutory powers, principally for the benefit of the unsecured creditors, under the general supervision of the court and the direct supervision of the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator. The trustee is a private individual or corporation appointed in all chapter 7, chapter 12, and chapter 13 cases and some chapter 11 cases. The trustee's responsibilities include reviewing the debtor's petition and schedules and bringing actions against creditors or the debtor to recover property of the bankruptcy estate. In chapter 7, the trustee liquidates property of the estate, and makes distributions to creditors. Trustees in chapter 12 and 13 have similar duties to a chapter 7 trustee and the additional responsibilities of overseeing the debtor's plan, receiving payments from debtors, and disbursing plan payments to creditors. Typing service A business not authorized to practice law that prepares bankruptcy petitions. U U.S. attorney A lawyer appointed by the President in each judicial district to prosecute and defend cases for the federal government.

Undersecured claim A debt secured by property that is worth less than the amount of the debt. Undue hardship The most widely used test for evaluating undue hardship in the dischargeability of a student loan includes three conditions: (1) the debtor cannot maintain – based on current income and expenses – a minimal standard of living if forced to repay the loans; (2) there are indications that the state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period; and (3) the debtor made good faith efforts to repay the loans. Unlawful detainer action A lawsuit brought by a landlord against a tenant to evict the tenant from rental property – usually for nonpayment of rent. Unliquidated claim A claim for which a specific value has not been determined. Unscheduled debt A debt that should have been listed by the debtor in the schedules filed with the court but was not. (Depending on the circumstances, an unscheduled debt may or may not be discharged.) Unsecured claim A claim or debt for which a creditor holds no special assurance of payment, such as a mortgage or lien; a debt for which credit was extended based solely upon the creditor's assessment of the debtor's future ability to pay.

          "content": "Appeals The losing party in a decision by a trial court in the federal courts normally is entitled to appeal the decision to a federal court of appeals. The Process Although some cases are decided based on written briefs alone, many cases are selected for an \"oral argument\" before the court. Oral argument in the court of appeals is a structured discussion between the appellate lawyers and the panel of judges focusing on the legal principles in dispute. Each side is given a short time — usually about 15 minutes — to present arguments to the court. Most appeals are final. The court of appeals decision usually will be the final word in the case, unless it sends the case back to the trial court for additional proceedings, or the parties ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. In some cases the decision may be reviewed en banc, that is, by a larger group of judges (usually all) of the court of appeals for the circuit. A litigant who loses in a federal court of appeals, or in the highest court of a state, may file a petition for a \"writ of certiorari,\" which is a document asking the Supreme Court to review the case. The Supreme Court, however, does not have to grant review. The Court typically will agree to hear a case only when it involves an unusually important legal principle, or when two or more federal appellate courts have interpreted a law differently. There are also a small number of special circumstances in which the Supreme Court is required by law to hear an appeal. Different types of cases are handled differently during an appeal. Civil Case Either side may appeal the verdict. Criminal Case The defendant may appeal a guilty verdict, but the government may not appeal if a defendant is found not guilty. Either side in a criminal case may appeal with respect to the sentence that is imposed after a guilty verdict. Bankruptcy Case An appeal of a ruling by a bankruptcy judge may be taken to the district court. Several courts of appeals, however, have established a bankruptcy appellate panel consisting of three bankruptcy judges to hear appeals directly from the bankruptcy courts. In either situation, the party that loses in the initial bankruptcy appeal may then appeal to the court of appeals. Appeals are decided by panels of three judges working together. The appellant presents legal arguments to the panel, in writing, in a document called a \"brief.\" In the brief, the appellant tries to persuade the judges that the trial court made an error, and that its decision should be reversed. On the other hand, the party defending against the appeal, known as the \"appellee,\" tries in its brief to show why the trial court decision was correct, or why any error made by the trial court was not significant enough to affect the outcome of the case. Other Types of Appeals A litigant who is not satisfied with a decision made by a federal administrative agency usually may file a petition for review of the agency decision by a court of appeals. Judicial review in cases involving certain federal agencies or programs — for example, disputes over Social Security benefits — may be obtained first in a district court rather than a court of appeals.
