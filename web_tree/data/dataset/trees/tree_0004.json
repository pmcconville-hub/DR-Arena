(“Fandom”) is pleased to provide information on the average monthly active recipients of the GameFAQs service (see https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ ) in the European Union (the “GameFAQs Service”). (“Recipients of the service” is defined under the DSA to mean a recipient of the service that has engaged with an online platform by either requesting the online platform to host information or being exposed to information hosted by the online platform and disseminated through its online interface”). In accordance with the obligation set forth in Article 24(2) of the DSA, Fandom estimates that the average monthly number of active users of the GameFAQs Service in the European Union from 1 February 2024 to August 31, 2024 is approximately 1.3 million. We define a monthly active user as a user (whether or not they have registered) who visited the GameFAQs Service in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. Please note that this is only an estimate based on the data available to Fandom at this time. This estimate is required to be published under the DSA, and may differ from user metrics reported in other contexts in certain key respects, and should not be used for any other purpose. The methodologies used to estimate average monthly recipients as defined in the DSA require significant judgment, and design inputs are subject to data and other limitations and are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. These estimates may be revised upwards or downwards as Fandom refines its approach and responds to the publication of methodology by the European Commission. II. Legal Representative In accordance with Article 13(1) of the DSA, Fandom has appointed Fandom Poland Sp. Z o.o. as its legal representative in the European Union to perform the obligations and undertake the responsibilities for and on behalf of Fandom with respect to the GameFAQs Service.

You may control the Push Messages in your device’s or the Application’s settings. Some of the Push Messages may be related to your location or to your use of the Application or Content. Your carrier may charge standard messaging, data and other fees for use of Push Messages, and these fees may appear on your mobile bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance. Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Push Messages and certain Push Messages may be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device. Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues. You may discontinue Push Messages in your device’s or the Application’s settings or by deleting the Application.

You acknowledge that the Application may check for updates to the Application that may be available to you. The Application may use location-based services to locate you. If you choose to use the Application, you consent to our and our third party providers determining your location. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, we grant you, and you hereby accept, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (a) install the Application on one mobile device owned by you or under your legitimate control; and (b) engage in non-commercial use of the Application. All rights to use the Application are granted on the condition that such rights are forfeited if you fail to comply with this Agreement. User Submissions Some of the Services may allow you to submit or transmit audio, video, text, or other materials, including so-called “user generated content” and “feedback” (collectively, “ User Submissions ”) to or through the Services. When you provide User Submissions, you grant to us and our affiliates and partners a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully sublicensable license to use, reproduce, archive, edit, translate, create derivative works of, make available, distribute, sell, display, perform, transmit, broadcast and in any other way exploit those User Submissions, and any names, voices, likenesses and other identifying information of persons that is part of those User Submissions, in any form, media, software, or technology of any kind now known or developed in the future, including, without limitation, for developing, manufacturing, and marketing products. You hereby waive any moral rights you may have in your User Submissions. You shall not transmit, submit or post the following to our Services: Information that infringes our or any third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights; Information that violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation; Information that is trade libelous, unlawfully threatening, unlawfully harassing, defamatory, obscene, explicit or vulgar, or otherwise injurious to us or third parties or that infringes on our or any third party’s rights of publicity or privacy; Information that contains any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, trap doors, back doors, easter eggs, time bombs, cancelbots or other code or computer programming routines that contain contaminating or destructive properties or that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; Information containing or constituting chain letters, mass mailings, political campaigning, or any form of “spam”; Information that is false, inaccurate or misleading; Commercial advertisements or solicitations without our written permission; or Federally trademarked and/or copyrighted information without our prior written permission. We respect your ownership of User Submissions. If you owned a User Submission before providing it to us, you will continue owning it after providing it to us, subject to any rights granted in this Agreement and any access granted to others. Please note that if you delete a User Submission from the Services: The User Submission may still exist in our backup copies, which are not publicly available. If your User Submission was shared with third parties, those third parties may have retained copies of your User Submissions, and neither we nor our affiliates have any responsibility for any uses of your User Submission that they might make. We retain the license specified above. Thus, for example, if we or one of our sublicensees obtained your user Submission for use in creating a derivative work before you deleted it, we or our sublicensee would remain free to complete the creation of that derivative work and thereafter exploit that derivative work for all purposes and at all times. We may refuse or remove a User Submission without notice to you. However, we have no obligation to monitor User Submissions, and you agree that neither we nor our affiliates will be liable for User Submissions or any loss or damage resulting from User Submissions, or for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any other user or third party in connection with or otherwise arising out of the Services. Except as provided in the Privacy Policy, we do not guarantee that User Submissions will be private, even if the User Submission is in a password-protected area. Accordingly, you should not provide User Submissions that you want protected from others. You bear all responsibility for your User Submissions. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant to us the license above and that your User Submissions do not violate this Section. If you provide us with any feedback or suggestions regarding the Services (“ Feedback ”), you hereby assign to us all rights in the Feedback and agree that we shall have the right to use such Feedback and related information in any manner it deems appropriate. We will treat any Feedback you provide to us as non-confidential and non-proprietary. You agree that you will not submit to us any information or ideas that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.

Legal Disputes You and we agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of this Agreement, your use of or access to the Services will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes section. Please read this Section carefully. It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims you and we have against each other are resolved. You agree that the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement. This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, if applicable.

Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, you must file any claim or action related to use of the Services or this Agreement within one year after such claim or action accrued. Otherwise, you will waive the claim or action. Arbitration/Class Waiver/Opt Out Clauses You and we each agree to resolve exclusively through final and binding arbitration any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and us (including any affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents), whether or not such dispute or claim involves a third party, relating in any way to any aspect of our relationship or any contact between us, direct or indirect, or arising out of this or previous versions of this Agreement, your use of or access to our Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services (“ Dispute ”). You and we agree to submit the Dispute to a single arbitrator under the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including when applicable the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Consumer Arbitration Rules, or, by separate mutual agreement, at another arbitration institution. The AAA’s rules, information regarding initiating a claim, and a description of the arbitration process are available at www.adr.org. The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA rules. As an alternative, you or we may bring a claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section regarding our agreement to arbitrate any Dispute (“ Agreement to Arbitrate ”), and the arbitrability of the Dispute. The arbitrator will decide whether the Dispute can be arbitrated. You and we agree that each of us may bring a Dispute against the other only on our own behalf, and not on behalf of a government official or other person or entity, or a class of persons or entities. You and we agree, if we are a party to the proceeding, not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, a claim brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or a consolidated claim involving another person’s use of the site or our services. You and we agree not to combine a claim that is subject to arbitration under this Agreement with a claim that is not eligible for arbitration under this Agreement. You and we agree to waive the right to a trial by jury for all disputes. You may opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing, within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, either by U.S. mail delivered to: Attn: Legal Department, Fandom, Inc. 550 California Street, Suite 830 San Francisco, CA 94104, or by email delivered to legal@fandom.com. You must include: (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or mobile telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of Section 1 above will be null and void as to that Dispute. This Agreement to Arbitrate will survive the termination of your relationship with us. Unless you and we agree otherwise, if you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, if the Agreement to Arbitrate is found by a court to be unenforceable, if your claim is not covered by the Agreement to Arbitrate, or if you neither are a resident of nor have a principal place of business in the US or Canada, you agree that any Dispute that has arisen, or may arise, between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in San Francisco, California. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make a change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to the notice address or the site link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to a claim that was filed in a legal proceeding between you and us prior to the effective date of the change. The change shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen, or may arise, between you and us. We will notify you of a change to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on our Services at least 30 days before the effective date of the change and/or by email.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that such notices will be effective upon our posting them in the relevant Service or delivering them to you via email. You may update your email address by visiting the Services where you have provided contact information. If you do not provide us with accurate information, we will not be responsible for failure to notify you. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. This Agreement, including all additional terms, conditions, and policies on the Services, constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all prior agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof. Nothing in this Agreement affects any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be removed or limited to the minimum extent such that the remainder of this Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. You authorize us to provide information concerning you and your activities to comply with applicable laws or respond to court order, subpoenas, or other lawful requests, or if we believe doing so would protect your safety or that of another person or protect the security of the Services, or as otherwise described in the Privacy Policy .

We may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason. However, if you paid us or an authorized Distribution Channel to acquire the Application, and we terminate this Agreement within one year after you made your payment for reasons other than your breach of this Agreement, you may request that we refund a prorated portion of the purchase price corresponding to the portion of such one year period for which our action caused you not to be able to use the Application. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in this Agreement, shall survive your acceptance of this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement; except that upon termination for any reason, all licenses granted by us to you will immediately terminate. Communications relating to the Services or otherwise referenced within this Agreement may be directed to support@fandom.com. Previous Terms of Use October 17, 2022",

If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, or if you’ve initially agreed for the application to access your camera and photos and you would like to stop the Apps from accessing them, you may turn them off at the device level.

Although the sections above describe our primary purpose(s) in collecting your information, in many situations we have more than one purpose. For example, if you complete an online purchase we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a business need in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our need to conduct our business.

We use services such as Google Ads’ Customer Match, LiveRamp, LinkedIn Matched Audiences, and Facebook Custom Audiences for these purposes.

When you provide consent to receive communications from that third party advertiser, your personal information will be managed by that third party’s own privacy policy. In some cases we may also ask if you would like us to share your information with other third-parties that are not described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Other Disclosures without Your Consent . We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws.

The information collected and stored by the social media sites remains subject to those sites’ privacy practices, including whether they continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on those third-party websites or services. Please exercise caution before sharing information on our Services that may identify you in the real world. TV and Audio Control Services We have partnered with certain third-party companies that offer TV and audio control services to enhance your video content viewing experience.

Desmond Cussen, Data Protection Officer c/o Fandom, Inc. 550 California Street, Suite 830 San Francisco, CA 94104 An authorized agent may make any of the requests above by using our online form or contacting us as noted above. If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of a user to communicate with us or to exercise a privacy right discussed above, you must be able to demonstrate that you have the requisite authorization to act on behalf of the user, and have sufficient access to that user’s laptop, desktop, or mobile device to exercise that user’s right digitally. If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of one of our users, then you can make a request on the user’s behalf by contacting us as set forth below: Such requests must include the following information: (1) a written authorization from the consumer that includes the consumer’s full name, address, telephone number and valid email address used by the consumer to interact with us, that is signed by the consumer and clearly bestows upon the agent the proper authority; and (2) a certificate of good standing with your state of organization. Alternatively, an acting agent can provide a valid power of attorney signed by the consumer on the agent’s behalf and a valid email address used by the consumer to interact with us. The email address of the consumer will be used to separately verify the agent’s authority with the consumer. You can also make the following choices regarding communications preferences: Promotional Emails . You may choose to provide us with your email address for the purpose of allowing us to deliver newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to you.

If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by emailing us (our contact information is below) with “NO SNAIL MAIL” in the subject line along with your name, address and zip code. Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed. Text Messages and Push Notifications. If you receive a text message from us that contains promotional information you can opt-out of receiving future text messages by replying “STOP” or “UNSUBSCRIBE.” You control on your device whether you receive push notifications. Online Tracking. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.

Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. However, if our site detects a GPC signal from your device, we will interpret it as a Do Not Sell or Share request under U.S. law and we will also interpret it as a request to limit the sale of personal information for targeted advertising for residents of the European Economic Area, the UK, China and Brazil. Cookies : You can review your settings by clicking the “cookie settings” link in the footer of most sites. Our Cookie Policy also provides more information on setting you control. How We Protect Personal Information No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure.
